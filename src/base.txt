Transcript:
(00:00) in this video we're going to talk about price action rules and why it is so important to have understanding of these rules why price action rules work it's simple it's because markets reflect human behavior human greed and fear and since the core human behavior hasn't change and most likely will not change Market will continue to move in the same way and will continue to form the same patterns again and again most retail Traders are unaware of the fact how price actually moves on the chart and why is that it's because average Trader gets first introduced to information
(00:36) that will do the complete opposite of what he should do to educate him most Traders at First Look for system that will do the work for them and they will look for indicator based strategies but as most Traders already know this is a FSE errand and indicators don't work they only show past performance all these fancy indicators look great at first but the only thing these indicators do is they clutter your chart having all these indicators is on a chart will stop you from learning about the true movement of price and it's going to be next to impossible to get
(01:07) the proper understanding about the price movement only when you start to focus on Raw naked price action you will understand how price actually moves since markets are not random and there is a reason to how price action moves There are rules that will help us to stay on the right side of the market and the first rule is the trend line rule which says after break of a trend line which means that the candles will close outside of the trend line new extreme is going to be formed and after new extreme is formed we expect correction phase or possibly straight up reversal now we
(01:42) have a downtrend looking structure on the chart so as price action Traders we want to find a pattern because price action is never alone and naked on the chart and is always contained by some form of a pattern you guys can see we have a nice bearish downtrend working lower and we have a triple confirmation of this downtrend so at this point on the structure is bearish and Trader is only looking for short opportunities notice what price created there was a break of this channel there were candles that Clos outside of this channel most Traders will take this information and
(02:13) they will think that the trend is over and they will start current Trend trading they will start looking for buying opportunities but at this point on according to trend line rules we know that we cannot go long just yet this downtrend needs to get new low it needs to get a retest of this previous and notice what price created it created move to New extreme and after new extreme was formed then we expect correction or possibly straight up reversal and price in this instance straight up revers and this is the uptrend now when you're safe to be
(02:44) looking for buying opportunities so this is the rule number one when you're following the trend line you're only looking for Longs after you get a proven Trend in opposite direction and after you have a break of a channel you expect new stream to be formed same thing will apply for the shorten channels as well notice as there's a downtrend working lower there are shortterm uptrends in between and these uptrends at the same time have a break and retest of a new extreme or at least attempt to create new extreme break new high only in this
(03:13) instance there's a break no new extreme form but it's because the downtrend is just too strong but you expect the same thing to happen even on a micro level even for these corrections after break of uptrend you expect new extreme to be form and then you know that this uptrend is over so this is the trend line rule bullish uptrend working higher break off the channel and the trend line rule says that after break new extreme is most likely going to be formed and price created new high and this high is higher than the high inside of this channel so the trend line rule was
(03:44) fulfilled after that price created a shorten downtrend which also had a break move to New extreme and then price indicated a correction phase so after you have a break in new extreme and you have a reversal pattern you can start looking for shorts but once this downtrend played out because this was just a shorten pattern the correction phase for this overall initial uptrend came into play so this is how you follow the trend line rule when price breaks the trend line don't start counter Trend trading just yet expect continuation of
(04:13) the previous Trend counter Trend trading while trend line is in play is against the price action rules and most of the time you will get burned after correction Trend can resume or reverse meaning after there's a break of a channel new ex form and there's a correction phase if the bias is strong enough there can be a larger pattern and Trend May resume or after that correction the new trend may start in the opposite direction the trend May reverse we have a nicely fitting uptrend working higher multiple confirmation
(04:44) indicating to me that this channel is valid so I'm following the trend line rule I'm only focusing on Long opportunities I'm not looking for shorts even when I have a break of this channel just because we have a break of this channel that doesn't indicate reversal that's against the trend line Rule and that's against the price action rule I expect for price to create new high price created new high formed a double top which is close enough to be considered as new high and after that price slowly Consolidated and there was
(05:15) eventually downtrend after that but only after you get a breaking new high the trend line rule is fulfilled and then you can start acting accordingly beish down working lower beautifully fitting Channel this is why Market geometry is a real thing and this is how you can understand that the structure is bearish you don't need any indicator all you can need is the simple naked chart naked candlesticks and you can get the understanding what the price is going to do price close outside of this channel indicated break this is not the time to
(05:45) buy the market just yet price created big move to New Low to new extreme and from this point on Traders are safe to at least play with the idea of possibly buying the market and eventually going long with with Trend around rule correlates the second price action rule that says Don't counter Trend trade a lot of beginner Traders when they're watching the strong Trend go they feel that the trend cannot go any further and they will start to pick tops and bottoms and this lot of times lead to never-ending frustration and to a lot of multiple losing streaks doesn't matter
(06:21) how good the signal bar looks how good the setup looks if the trend is in play under any circumstances you cannot counter Trend trade just yet you will use the trend line rule to identify the trend to follow the trend and if you cannot find the perfect trend line you will still follow the overall bias only when you get a trend improving opposite direction that's when you can start looking for entries in that Trend but under any circumstances you cannot pick tops cannot pick bottoms and you cannot counter Trend Trend probabilities are just not in your favor and most Traders
(06:55) are losing their money trying to pick tops and bottoms markets are designed to make counter Trend entries look favorable and there are designed to make with Trend pullbacks to look sketchy for that reason a lot of Traders are attempting to buy the bottom in strong downtrends but most reversal attempts in Trends will fail these rallies to the upside are just reversal attempts and most of them will fail there against the overall trend when you are not sure if the trend ended or not you follow the overall bias and even if you are struggling to find the proper trend line you are sticking with to over buyas and
(07:30) you are not cend trading don't sell the uptrend even if long traps occur sometimes there can be a good long setup good buying opportunity in a bullish structure in a bullish Trend Behavior may be wrong the trade may be a little bit of a congested which is another rule we're going to talk about there may be a shortterm trend line that is in play that needs to play out remember the trend line rule it goes even for the shter term Trends as well you cannot sell the long trap even if you are confident that the buyers are trapped because the trend is still in play and you're still going against the trend and
(08:00) arts are not in your side you just let these long traps play out and you're still sticking with the trend you're still following the trend trend is your friend the saying has been around for a long time there's a reason why and this rule goes for shorten channels as well even if there's a small Channel and the structure is not this big because right now I have an example of a quite a strong bullish uptrend even if the uptrend is minimal you still don't want to current Trend trade unless you have a break of a trend line and you extreme formed this one is a big one the trading range rule the most important thing to
(08:29) understand about trading range rule is that most breakouts of trading ranges will fail but we see it all on the internet beginner Traders are trading breakouts majority of Traders are trying to trade breakouts and they keep losing money because most breakouts of trading ranges will fail at least temporarily there can be a pullback and the breakout May succeed eventually but if you are trading the breakout you want to take it on the breakout pullback setup you don't want to trade the breakout in its breakout phase because most breakouts of trading ranges will pull back into to
(09:00) trading range and the breakout will fail these breakouts are working just enough to keep the majority Traders trying but in the long term this is not the proven strategy to approach the market and it's against price action Rule now when we are watching trading range we're observing the health of a trading range we want to see if there is a bullish imbalance or bearish imbalance now trading range rule also says not only most breakouts will fell but we want to buy low and we want to sell High you want to do the opposite but the common sense is telling you congestion is just
(09:31) a small pattern of a trading range and you want to avoid trading these congestions that's a price action rule trading range rule because congestion is just a micro trading range and the price gets too indecisive there and you want to stay away from these trades price is swinging up and down up and down we as price action Traders need to identify the support identify the resistance ours are never alone on the chart there's always some form of a pattern remember price action reflects human behavor behavior and this Behavior always result
(10:02) into price action patterns price formed double top and we have a break below support but notice the breakout ended up failing why because most breakouts of trading ranges will fail price broke above the resistance and what ended up happening breakout fell again and price pulled back into a trading range this is how you approach trading ranges and this is the train range rule that you want to follow you're looking for opportunities off the bottom off top and you're trying to fade the breakout you're trading them against the direction of a breakout if
(10:35) breakout breaks to the downside you want to look for buy and if breakout breaks to the upside you want to look for sell another trading range structure huge breakout to the upside that is looking very bullish a lot of Traders rely on momentum but the breakout snap back into trading range another breakout right here price pull back into range another breakout and price pull back into range again most breakouts of trading ranges will fail most beginner Traders trade breakout they like the momentum they see
(11:03) so many bullish bars breaking up because a lot of times trading ranges are boring markets they're slow and Traders just cannot deal with this they're too anxious to take the trade once they see price breaking out they will start buying but what they're don't realizing they're just taking other side of the professional orders which they're trying to sell because if I want to sell I want to sell as high as I can so I want to sell I need somebody to take the other side of my order people are buying I'm selling it will result into Market pulling back into training range like
(11:33) this another beautiful fail breakout scenario because price will just pull back into training range after breakout 90% of these breakouts will fail some will eventually work there's no denying that but you cannot try to look for the one that will eventually work and there are instances includes in price session that will help you understand which breakout is going to work and which fail such as bullish or bearish imbalance most breakouts will fail even in small TR trading ranges this right here this small little consolidation is a trading range structure just like we saw in the
(12:05) examples earlier just on a small micr frame there's a support there is a resistance there's just indecision there's no clear Direction price broke to the downside strongly this is a fell breakout and price pull back into trading range notice we traded up into this trading range so you expect for price to eventually break to the upside and even when there was a breakout to the upside notice price pulled back first because the first breakout will fail at least temporarily and this is the breakout pullback when now you know
(12:34) that you want to go long after price pullback and now you're safe to look for Longs but most breakouts will fail even from these tiny consolidations and you want to stay away from trading in the middle of these tiny little consolidations that's against the rule we just talked about three price action rules that mainly has to do with the structure and the bias of the market but is there a rule that will help us identify proper place to enter yes there is and it's called the high probability setup rule when you train your eyes to see the price movement you will realize
(13:05) that market moves in pairs of twos Market is not just pointing straight up or straight down no these would be w-shaped reversals and they are not common there are small pullbacks in between and these are two Lega pullbacks remember price reflects human behavior what hity setup rule does it will tell us when to enter and when we put odds on our side that the the trade has high likelihood of succeeding so what is a high prity setup High prity setup is a second entry at key entry point with the direction of a trend it is a failed second entry that goes against the current Trend fail breakouts or higher
(13:44) lows lower high confirmation setups now these setups don't mean anything on their own if we want to take a high prity setup we need to combine it with the key entry point this is the place on the chart where High probity setup can appear now key entry is a trend line support or resistance line and exponential moving average now I'm aware the exponential moving average is a indicator but we use this indicator only as a supportive tool we are not relying on this blindly this is very useful tool that can help you identify the proper
(14:19) key entry point and can tell you information about the structure this is what the high prob setups look like notice we have a beish structure so what we have to do we have to draw the channel we have a trend line working lower notice we have a break and a new extreme perfectly following the trend line rule I mentioned that price likes to move in pairs of twos and this is what it looks like we have a first leg correction second leg and this is the key entry point you guys can see the trend line support or resistance line or this blue line 21 bar exponential moving
(14:50) average this is the twole pullback so we have a downtrend working lower price is working to the upside we have a short uptrend that had a break a new extreme remember the TR L you keep drawing it even for the shortterm corrections so you know that the uptrend played out and price created first attempt to sell second bullish leg up and the second attempt to sell it is off the two key entry points not only the trend line but the 21 bar exponential moving as well and this is the place where the odds of this trade succeeding are highly in your
(15:23) favor so as you guys can see two Lea pullback second entry short at the key entry point uption working higher break and new extreme first trend line break you're following the trend line rule you expect to get new extreme so you're still thinking about selling you're not cont trading at this point on this a twole pullback second entry short and resulted in a big move to New extreme this time you're below EMA you're at the exponential moving average even though you're not coming off the trend line you're still following the rule because you're combining the trend line rule
(15:51) with the high prity setup rule I also talked about a fail second entry that goes against the trend but it's fairly simple when we we have a bullish structure working to the upside we're not concentrating we're following the trend line rule we're looking for second entry Longs two leg a pullbacks at the key entry points but we can also take a felt to like a pullback to the downside felt second entry short because the trend is to the upside it's not to the downside so any second entry short means nothing and it means that it's going to most likely fail and we have a second
(16:23) entry short right here new low first entry short second entry short and we have a second entry short failure this is the fail second short against to overall trend your stop loss goes Swan below this signal bar and would have resulted in winning trade same scenario right here price created a new low first entry short pull back second entry short so this is a felt second entry short also at the same time it is a second entry long first lag pullback second leg first entry long second entry long so the high prity setup rule says that you're only taking these setups that
(16:54) have higher chance of succeeding you're not interested in taking setups they are not confirming the key entry points they're are far away from EMA from the trend line and there are not variations over two Lega pullbacks we have bunch of entries right here but you're not interested in taking these entries chasing the market you're not interested in selling the market High probity setup is when price pulls back to key entry points this is where a lot of smallart Traders are starting to buy on high probability set up the fifth price
(17:25) action rule that you need to follow is the signal bar rule which means you only want to take Longs above bullish bars and you only want to take shorts below bearish bars you only want to enter with the proper signal bar signal bar must confirm the direction and the momentum of the market these are few examples of good bullish bars that you want to go long above and these are just few examples of good bearish bars that you want to sell below you never want to sell below These Bars and you never want to buy Above These Bars you need to combine the high probity setup rule with
(18:02) the signal bar rule so you can maximize the probabilities of trade succeeding of course stronger the context the signal bar is less important sometimes the context may be just so strong where you can afford to take a slightly less ideal signal bar and you're still following the rules but for the most part you want to stick to this rule you want to follow a good signal bar let's now take a look how to use these rules in markets let's talk about a price action rules in trading range structures when I'm trading trading ranges there are a
(18:36) couple key points that I have to go through in my mind when I'm trying to identify a high prity setups and these are just the few points that quickly flash through my mind number one I try to identify the structure it is a uptrend or is a downtrend or is a trading range I want to locate key levels if I know that is a trading range I want to find a support and resistance line because Market likes to oscillate in between these lines and if I want to follow the train range rule which means I want to buy low sell high and fade the breakouts I need to identify my support
(19:08) and resistance correctly I also want to locate trend lines I want to locate the shorten trend lines because there are Trends working even inside of a trading range trend line rules still apply even inside of the trading range for the most part I'm careful trading in a low trading range I want to stay away from congestion that's very important rule I want to look for setups to fade the breakout following the trading range rule Buy Low sell High I want to be patient don't want to chase entries in case I miss the trade if I miss the trade I need to wait for another high prity setup to appear I cannot just jump
(19:44) the gun and risk taking entry there is not a high probability I cannot trade a breakout I cannot take first entries I cannot C and trade that will not result in long-term consistent success I'm looking for entries at exponential moving average I'm looking for good signal bars if I'm about to enter and I'm looking for second entries with the trend and F second entries against the trend because like I said there are Trends working even inside of trading ranges so when I'm looking at the trading range like this what I have to do I need to identify my key levels and
(20:14) I need to identify my short and trend lines because you guys can see there's uptrend break two legs to new extreme downtrend break new low and you guys can see the trend line will playing out perfectly after each new break there's a new extreme and then reversal up working High a little break new extreme so at this point on I expect for price to go down but at this point on we are in the middle of trading range so I'm just sitting patiently I'm not doing anything notice price created last leg to new
(20:40) extreme and eventually traded down so I keep drawing my short and channels I keep following the trend line rule we have a break new stream form which tells me that the downtrend played out and notice we broke below the training range and most breakouts of training ranges will fail so I'm looking for opportunity to trade back into train range I'm following the trend line rule I'm following the training range rule I'm following the high bity setup rule but I don't have a great signal bar so I'm just waiting patiently price indeed pull
(21:10) back into training range I need to draw the shorten channels at this point on I have a strong bullish uptrend and I'm waiting if I get a good setup at the exponential moving average at the key entry point because I'm most likely not going to get good entries off of this channel because it is too tight and it will be too far away from the exponential moving average notice price is strongly continuing to the upside we bounce off the resistance but I'm not selling just yet that would be against the trend I don't want to content Trend
(21:40) just yet we have a 20 bullish bars consecutive working higher only bearish bar was this one right here but you can classify this as a bullish bar as well because it has gigantic bullish steem at the bottom so I expect according to trend line rule to get new extreme I notice price gr new high first entry long pullback second entry long is about to form where at the important key entry point even though the signal bar is not the greatest the context is so strong that after 20 consecutive bullish bars I'm going to get new extreme and this is a second entry long and then price
(22:13) created new low first entry short F second entry short this is a f second entry short that goes against the overall trend it is once again off the key entry point signal bar is great and I still need to get new extreme I'm not concentrating just yet and if I miss the second entry long I cannot go long all the way up to here now my scalp was already made and I need to wait for proper pullback again F second entry short worked new high was formed and according to trend line rule we now expect correction or straight up reversal but I'm going to combine the trend line rule with the trading range
(22:45) Rule and most breakouts will fail so I can take this fail breakout as a high probability setup and I can expect for price to pull back into training range at the same time still following the shortterm trend line rule so these are the rules that are going through my mind when I'm trading in a trading range identifying key levels sticking to shorten channels for the most part avoiding trading in the middle avoiding congestions I'm still following trend line rule with the key entry point setups with the high probability setups and I'm trying to fade the breakouts price action rules for the uptrend I
(23:17) still need to identify what is the structure I'm still trying to follow the trend I'm not looking into counter Trend Trend just yet following the trend line rule identifying the key entry points identifying the High BR the setups not trying to jump the gun in case I miss a trade I'm not entering at the very highs of the move I want to take the pullbacks I'm trying to stay away from congestions I'm drawing my short and trend lines for bearish Corrections because I want to see the bearish corrections play out so I can take long opportunities I try to identify good signal bar after new high
(23:50) is reached buying is on hold for short period of time until we get more confirmation and if price keeps creating multiple new extremes that's the indic indiction that there is a probably new bigger channel in play which is typical for strong uptrends so when I'm looking at the structure like this I have a break but I see price created new extreme another new extreme and another new extreme we just keep pushing higher price is failing to close below EMA this is indicating to me that we are still in a bullish bias structure so I'm still looking for long opportunities I cannot sell just yet I would need to see a
(24:25) reversal pattern below EMA or proven downtrend for me to just sell I'm stay away from these congestions so at this point on I'm still thinking long but I cannot just buy at the top of the move like that it's far away from EMA and price can pull back I want to see price pulling back this is where smart Traders are buying this is time for me to capitalize on a discount in the market and price created a new high first entry long I'm not interested in taking a long entry here because just a first entry and price created we tickle over here and created a second entry long we have
(24:57) a little inside bar here but this is the the proper second entry long right here so this is a twole pullback at the key entry point under bullish structure great signal bar this is a high probity setup and this is the entry that I want to take after I take this entry I can hold the runner but I cannot take entries at these highs we're now far away from key entry point and at this point on since price ke is pushing higher there's a probably a different pattern there's a spike in a channel pattern which is typical when the first leg is steep and then the channel
(25:26) flattens the second leg flattens now we have a b Channel pattern and notice price created newow formed first entry short second entry short but I'm not taking this trade because it is far away from EMA and it's far away from the trend line I'm still patient here and I'm just watching Market go without me preferably I'm still holding the runner and letting this portion of the market run so I can capitalize and locking profits without me getting anxy that I am missing a big move price is finally pulling back to my key entry point to the EMA in the form of a new high first
(25:56) in Long second in long with twole pullback big bullish Bar following the signal bar rule second in Long in a strong bullish structure all rules apply you the short and down TR had to break a new extreme so this is a high prity setup followed by a high low confirmation of a twole pullback a new low form first entry short second entry short that goes against the trend failure off two key entry points great signal bar still sticking with the trend and at this point on once again I'm not chasing entries up here I'm only interested in high prity setups no this this is the point where price is creating these big
(26:32) moves up and without the knowledge of price session you're wondering why price is turning up from these points what's so magical about these points the price will always bounce here well it's because there's a key entry point it's because there's a twole pullback and it's because all other price action rules are being met price action rules for downtrend are the same as for uptrend just vice versa I'm still following the same rule but I'm looking for short opportunities I see a somewhat range like structure but with a bearish
(27:02) bias Highs are still lower than the previous highs and the lows are still also lower and lower so we have a range structure right here but with bearish bias so at this point on I'm not particularly looking for Longs I'm just waiting patiently for a good opportunity to appear notice what is happening next price is continuing working sideways price forming new low and created a twole pullback first entry short pullback second entry short can I take this entry well I don't really want to take this entry why because it's getting
(27:33) a little bit stacked we have multiple bars just working next to each other showing indecision this is not showing me any momentum and we close above EMA if I want to go short I preferably want to sell below EMA and we are in the middle of this train range as well so this is not particularly the perfect area I want to sell however I can still see the low being lower than this and than this there's a possible down TR working lower notice what for next there was a lower high confir setup of this second entry short not only that price now confirmed momentum and pushed below
(28:04) EMA so now this is better entry lower high after second entry short below EMA confirmation setup and it's according to rules price is failing to reach the resistance is staying below and the possible downtrend is now coming into duration it can also be treated as a small breakout pullback of the micro congestion right here because these bars are just small little congestion working next to each other at this point on structure is clear bearish downtrend I can identify the stronger downtrend it fits nicely off the lows and as the price is pushing lower we have multiple setups either first entries or whatever
(28:42) setups they're just far away from exponential moving average I'm not interested I'm not interested in buying the market it seems the price moved too far down we're way over done it's time to pick a nice signal bar to pull back that is not how you're going to maximize the probabilities on your side you only want to stick with the direction of a trend and this trend line is still in play there was a newow form first entry short second entry short to like a pullback but signal bar is dogey horrible I'm waiting patiently price
(29:10) created another second entry short why am I calling this another second entry short because we have here what looks like almost to be a micro double bottom and micro double bottoms reset the count so technically I can treat it as a first lack second lack first entry short second entry short this right here right now now has a much better signal bar it is at the key entry point and this is the proper entry price for a lower high confirmed the to leg a pullback but the signal bar is horrible so even though context is perfect here and I can take
(29:41) signal bar is not great lower Highs are supposed to have good signal bars they're confirmation setups so this is how you're using price action rules you're still sticking with the trend and you want to see price pull back to key entry point another new low form another twole pullback where I trim play with a breaking new high EMA keeps holding price key entry point second entry short great signal bar high probability setup the sculp was made price pushed higher confirmed the key entry point so you're still inside this channel price form a lower high of this key entry point you
(30:14) can actually consider taking this entry off the trend line but if you want to wait for sure entry to get the confirmation you can wait for lower high that will confirm this bounce off the key entry point and it's actually first entry short second entry short so this is a great entry as well and price not only formed a lower high it Formed even felt second entry long below EMA in a strong downtrend you're coming off the trend line and a second entry long that goes against the trend is a still high prity setup after that notice price is losing momentum first break of a channel
(30:46) you expect new extreme and these are the rules for a high probability setup if the signal bar is bad like on this entry right here I'm not interested this is a horrible dogee I really want to see a great signal bar if context is good I can have signal bar that is not perfect but the signal bar still has to be somewhat decent and this p dogee is not what I want to sell below these are the price action rules that you need to know and these rules will keep you on the right side of the market good luck

Transcript:
(00:00) there are a few high probability setups but one of the most important high probability setups that we can identify using price action is a with trend setup why because on most charts there are multiple trends being present whether it is a big trend the large trend for the day or just a bunch of small trends that are working inside of a training range unless the train range is very tight there are small trends playing out every trend has multiple phases we have a correction phase and we have a push phase correction phase followed by a
(00:33) push phase correction phase followed by a push phase correction phase and followed by another push phase this is the behavior according to price action when it comes to trends and the burden on traders is to identify where this correction is over and when the push phase is about to begin because if you can understand and read the market correctly when the push phase is about to begin you can capitalize on the width trend momentum and this is where our high probability price action setup will come into play as price session traders we can identify
(01:05) when the correction is over just by counting bars just by looking at the proper pattern now to like a pullback is a number one high priority setup if it forms under the right conditions we're going to talk about what those right conditions are too like a pullback helps us to identify when the correction is over and when the push phase can potentially begin and it comes down to human psychology to human behavior when humans try something once they will just not give up they will try it one more time to see if it will fail again or if it
(01:37) works too like a pullback will offer a second entry high probability setup now second entry if it forms under the right conditions it needs to form at proper key entry points the key entry points are trend lines exponential moving average 21 bar ema and support and resistance key levels as a price asking trader you're not interested in using any indicators you need to learn through the price action alone just using the price session tools and the correction needs to play out for second entry to be a high probability the two legged
(02:07) pullback will hint us where it is the safe place to sell since we're talking about downtrend in order for us to safely identify the tool like a pullback and second entry short we need to understand how to count the legs the bullish lag is a series of bullish bars or it can be even just one bullish bar bearish lag is a series of bearish bars it can be just one bearish bar and since we have a downtrend working lower when we are looking for opportunity to sell when we're looking for the two like a pullback we always start the count
(02:37) from the lowest low so this right here is the lowest low it broke lower count reset so this is the lowest low inside of this downtrend so this is where the count begins and we can see that we have first bullish lag the first bullish leg consists of this one bullish bar the second bullish bar now this bullish lag is going to be in play unless there is a break below the low of the last bar inside the series of the bullish life we have a series of two bars first bullish lag second bullish flag and suddenly we have a break below the
(03:08) low of this bar right here indicating first entry short and the first bullish lag played out and the first bullish lag is over and the first bearish leg may begin notice the second leg is continuing and this right here is a second bullish lag and we have a break below indicating a second entry short this right here is the first bar second bar and third bar on the third bar of the second bullish lag we finally had a break below its low indicating that the second bullish lag played out and this is the two-legged pullback
(03:42) indicating to us that the bullish correction played out and the main trend resumed that's the whole point of this two-legged pullback of this price action setup it will tell you when you can start looking for resuming the trend and looking to sell if it forms at the right key entry point which you did and the other conditions are in favor as well every time the lack will be broken it will form a chance for sellers to sell so this right here is the first bullish lag trigger below indicating first entry short second bullish like forming trigger
(04:12) below indicating second entry short it resulted in a nice trend continuation setup downtrend is in play and we have another key entry point trend line so you combine two key entry points and a two legged pullback this is a high quality setup just by counting bars bearish like can be serious of multiple beige bars or just one beige bar our first bearish leg inside of this correction is a two bar leg we have a first bearish bar followed by a second berry bar there is no trigger above neither one of these bars highs and then we have a third bar
(04:47) creating this first bearish lag but we have a trigger above notice one thick trigger above this bar right here indicating first entry long and the first bearish lag is broken and then we have a second bearish leg starting to form because the first century long was stopped so we have a second better schlag the next bar after this big bench bar just had a trigger above its high indicating that this second bearish flag is over and we have a first century long pull back second inch long first leg down pull back second leg down is a two
(05:17) legged pullback at the key entry point indicating that the bearish pullback played out that it is okay to resume the buys and be buying the market at this point and also notice you have a small little high here but this high is higher by just one tick which means you reset the count from the highest high the highest high is always the place where the count is being reset we start our count from this high right here first century long second entry long first entry long and the first entries in general may not be as reliable because
(05:46) they're indicating that the correction may continue the pullback may not be over just yet only after there are two legs and there's the second attempt this is where the bears will throw in the towel and bulls are about to resume the market as a price session trader i'm going to use the exponential moving average just as a supportive indicator to help me identify where possible key entry points are going to be and i'm going to be drawing shortened or long term trend lines so i can properly identify the key entry point and at that
(06:15) point once i see that the structure is bullish i'm just looking for pullbacks and looking for triggers if there is a second entry as a first bearish lag first bar second bar third bar no break above and then we have a bullish bar indicating break above so this first bearish lag is over and first bullish lag may start second base like started and then we have trigger above this bullish bar indicating a second entry long new high first century long pullback second entry long trend resumption entry as the trend is
(06:45) continuing i'm just looking for the same pattern all over again new high right here which i'm going to reset the count i'm going to count here but we have only first century long and count reset new high first bearish lag one single bearish bar instantly form a first century long just by one tick broke above the high of this bullish bar the second bearish lag is continuing making its way all the way to key entry point and above this doji bar a second entry long trigger first leg first century long second bearish lag
(07:14) second entry long we have a first century long pull back second and drilling you can see sometimes the legs may not be as visible this right here is a first bearish lag first century long just by one take break below and we have a second entry long it can be this tiny but it is a variation of the two like a pullback and it is a second inch long 2k entry point while the uptrend is about to resume and this pattern appears on every single time frame and on every single instrument this is apple stock weekly time frame here we have a nasdaq
(07:45) five minute chart we have new low form right here first century short break below pull back second entry short two key entry points notice this bullish lag has one bearish bar inside of it does that concern us no that doesn't because there is no break below this bearish bar that doesn't mean what color it is as long as there is no break the bullish leg continues the bullish leg was broken right here after there is a one take break below this bar right here second bullish leg continuing second entry short where i can continue pushing lower
(08:14) new low first century short pull back second entry short so in this scenario bullish lag is just one bar here correction second bar here bullish leg ended normal formed first century short pullback second entry short two-legged pullback at the key entry point to like a pullback is designed to predict a small market move for a scalp you're not about to predict a massive swing trade you're about to predict a smaller portion of a scalp from two key entry points to resume the trend after the correction played out
(08:46) daily chart the bitcoin new high formed first bearish lag first entry long trigger above this bar right here second bearish like continuing two bearish bars and the second entry long second entry long trigger technically above this bar right here but you need to go along above bullish bar so this is why i'm marking this bar right here another new high first century long just by one single tick this bar right here broke one tick higher above this polish bar instantly stopping the first entry long because the correction may continue sometimes
(09:14) for centuries will work sometimes they won't it is all 50 50 and you will not make consistent money you will only make it consistent if you keep waiting for the high probability setup to make its way to the key entry point and there is a second entry long forming first bearish slack pull back second bearish lag and a second inch long your stop loss goes one tick above the signal bar you would have had to write this out but eventually market would resume and the uptrend would continue and here we have a micro two like a pullback because we
(09:40) have a new high right here first bearish bar second berry bar third base bar all indicating bearish momentum we have a trigger one tick above this bearish bar indicating first century long and then it gets stopped instantly and notice while the first entry long was stopped the bar instantly reversed to the upside forming a second entry long on the same bar when the first entry long was stopped new high first century long it stopped second inch long one take about this bar right here goal level price session trader
(10:11) is to predict where the pullback is going to end and then the trend is going to resume the correction phase will end and push phase will begin and the two-legged pullback is indication of bearish momentum being over depleting and buyers are about to step in allowing you to buy low and sell high new high formed first bearish lag no tick above this bar right here remains unbroken and right here we have even continuation of the first bearish lag this inside bar has one tick trigger above its high breaking the first
(10:44) bearish lag indicating first century long pullback second bearish lag beginning second entry long right here stop loss goes one take below the entire swing in this case because this is a inside bar it is a key entry point new high bearishly continuing no break above its highs first bar that received a break above its high first century long pullback second entry long at two key entry points another new high indicating push phase is about to end correction phase is beginning first century long take one thing higher
(11:18) pull back two barbary flag second entry long triggering one tick trigger above its high right here on this inside bar of two key entry points we can see two bearish lags in each correction now second entry needs to form under the right conditions for us to consider it a high probability setup it needs to form at the key entry point the correction trend has to play out signal bar must be bullish to go long and signal bar must be bearish to go short what does it mean correction has to play out you're drawing the channels
(11:49) for the main trends but you're also drawing the channels for the shortened corrections if you have a bearish downtrend the bullish correction has a trend inside of it as well and it needs to form a new extreme for us to consider the opportunities safe to sell new law correction in play no safe energy to sell new low correction in play break new high of the correction indicating that this bullish trend played out and we have a first entry short counting from this low first attempt to sell pullback second attempt to sell buy the
(12:22) best is a two key entry point signal bar is bearish and correction played out this is a high probability price action setup followed by a lower high confirmation setup and a felt second inch long second inch long is going to be a trap why because the context is bearish so you can use even the two like a pullback in opposite direction to help you identify a trap but it's a whole other story

Transcript:
(00:00) let's talk about the Journey of the average Trader why Traders want to learn a trade it's simple Traders are lowered in by the idea of being free and the promise of riches and since the beginner Trader has no idea where to start or how to trade he naturally reverts to looking for tools to trade for him indicators and after realizing indicators don't work another brand new strategy is on the horizon and eventually frustration gets to the point where Trader decides trading is not for him and I started the same way me and my friends spend
(00:30) countless hours and sleepless nights trying to figure out the best combinations of multiple indicators that will result being profitable and of course nothing worked but I was convinced that I just hadn't found the right combination of variables of the indicators I tried everything out of the sun you know maybe if I just tweak this thing can sell a bit more from 32 to 40.
(00:51) and if I just tweak the RSI from 65 to 45 maybe it will work and what if I add a little babes Fibonacci and Bollinger Bands they must be working since the internet is full of it right no eventually I got rid of all the indicators and I just started looking how to trade without indicators how to trade pure price action what is price action in simple terms you just observe the pure price and analyze every single candle every single bar without any clutter to achieve consistent profitability Traders need to have an edge over the
(01:23) markets it's simple the more you're able to anticipate where the market is going the better chances you have to make more money Edge gives Traders a better art with the market and allows traders to find setups with better success rate and when you analyze pure price action then when you wait for your Edge to form you can take advantage of the markets okay so is the proper Edge well you must understand how Market moves where the major moves form and you need to master major aspects of price action the very first thing I need to do is I need to
(01:54) make sure I read the price session correctly this is important I need to identify the bias is the market trending where is it trending these are the questions I'm always asking myself or is it sideways if the market is trending upwards my main focus is to look for long setups mainly when the market is turning downwards my main focus is to look for short setups mainly if the market is working sideways well I can trade it both ways but I absolutely must have some level of understanding what is the structure of the market I don't have
(02:23) to be perfect you don't have to be perfect it's important to remember that but you have to be close if I want to follow price action properly and if I want to follow price session rules probably so this is the first part of your Edge second you need to be aware of the fact that Major Market moves don't occur randomly they happen in important places on the chart at key entry points so if I want to predict where the major moves may form I need to find the proper key entry point which is either trendline support resistance key level
(02:53) or the exponential moving average I only use one indicator as a supportive indicator only and this is the 21 bar exponential moving average it only helps me with my analysis of pure price session I don't trade moving average crossovers none of that stuff so now that I know what's the main bias and I know where the key and Chip Point may be I cannot just take any setup I like in price action some setups have high likelihood of succeeding than others if all the rules a line my goal is to take high probability setup only at key entry
(03:23) point under the right Market context and the high priority setup is a variation of the tool like a pullback second entry felt second entry lower high high low confirmation setup for breakout or double track I talked about these setups more in my videos in the beginner playlist if all first three factors now align then you need to make sure the behavior of the setup is correct meaning you have a good signal bar confirming your setup and confirming your momentum that's important because sometimes the single bar can form a very ugly and this
(03:55) is designed for the market that the other side stepped in and you don't really want to be taking the setup because the single bar is not confirming your initial analysis I also need to make sure the setup is not congested because the congestion is indecision in the market and reliability of the setup decreases during price congestion that's it you just decide if rules are being met and either take the setup or don't let's now take a look at the price chart and how would you use the ad Edge that you've learned the first thing I need to
(04:22) do I need to ask myself what is the bias and right now I can see that the bias is drainage isn't it because there is no clear uptrend or downtrend well I can see we have option working down to working but we have move up and move down and basically Market didn't change much and you can see that I'm already drawing these channels and this is important because the price action is always following some pattern these candles they're never alone and naked on the chart there's always a pattern working and these channels are key entry
(04:49) points so I always follow the price session and want to file the price session rule because after there's a break of a channel you don't reverse the market you expect new extreme and then after new extremist form the market May reverse with your downtrend we have a break new low and since it's a train range I'm going to identify the key levels okay so more information from the market is being presented to me and this is what I do I just follow the price section and I just read Candle by candle bar by bar trying to make sense what the
(05:19) market is doing and this is what you need to do this is what you need to train your brain to be focusing on so right now I can see a very strong bullish Spike very strong Spike multiple consecutive bullish bars first thing I'm going to do I'm going to find a channel find a key entry point so I know where the market is going because chances I high the at this Market this option will not reverse it will attempt to get a new extreme if we get a break okay and notice what we have we have a little break outside this Channel and now the
(05:46) question is can I go long here because I expect new extreme I expect new high for this reason I need to make sure I'm at the key entry point which I am I'm at the exponential moving average which is the supportive indicator and now I need to properly count the entry because remember if I want to take high probability setup it needs to be a variation would do like a pullback or some other high probability setup I cannot just randomly buy or sell just first entry or fourth entry I need to count the proper entry find a two-legged
(06:13) pullback because it comes down to human psychology if Traders try something once and it fails they usually try it again and it's just how the price action is depicted throughout the years so since I'm counting for Longs I'm gonna count from the latest high so this is the highest high you can see bars working lower and if you get a break above the bar this will trigger the first entry so we have new high first century long it failed and we have second inch long and by the way I have a video about how to count entries in my beginner a playlist
(06:42) so this is a second entry long is this a high probability setup it is is the single bar good it's great police signal bar great tail at the bottom all the cells got trapped and at the close of the bar everybody started buying a closed above EMA and notice I also draw the micro downtrends because this whole price section works there are also channels inside of the main channel so the downtrend has a break new low which is indicating to me that I can now think about buying again so this is a second entry long everything is aligning
(07:09) structure is train range we're heading from the bottom probably to the Top This bullish Trend needs to high so this is the shortened bias downtrend laid out it is a high quality setup I can go long and it created a quick scalp your stop loss goes one thick below single bar so you were never hit and notice what we have next we have a third second entry short because not only I'm counting for Longs remember I'm counting for felt second attempts but I'm looking for people to get trapped and since the structure is bullish because this trend
(07:35) is the shortened pattern needs to get him high I can count for second entry short because the shorts are going to get trapped going short on the wrong side of the market since this option is to get new high so from this low I'm going to reset the count as a first entry short pull back second entry short single bar is a little bit neutral you can wait but during failures you can take aggressive single bar now notice what we have another new high I'm going to reset the count at first entry long second and too long horrible single bar
(07:58) I cannot take it I have new high of the uptrend but notice what's happening Market keeps pushing higher brand new series of high highs and high lows and the EMA Keys holding every single time so this is a pattern in price session that is called a spike and a channel pattern because we spiked up we consolidate it we have a congestion right at the EMA and this is typical house Spike and the channel will a lot of times perform so this is a bullish structure still in the market there are no signs of the bearish pressure all the major buys right now in
(08:27) this market still is in the hands of bull so I'm still only looking for setups to go long okay and this is what I do I just file the price session bar by bar looking for patterns working with the EMA accounting for entries so this is the key entry point the main key entry point Spike and a channel pattern and I have new high for essential on second into long great bullish bar I'm gonna put my stop loss below and it failed and it's okay I'm gonna bother by this nothing is 100 in price action no trading strategy is 100 if you
(08:57) want Perfection you have to choose different job because you will never achieve 100 consistency it doesn't work it doesn't happen it is impossible because these markets they are controlled by the institutions you can't move the market your retail Trader only thing you do as a retail Trader is you follow the footprints of the big players you follow the institutions and the goal is just to take advantage take a little piece of the moves they are creating the central banks the bigger hedge funds the institutions the other ones were moving
(09:24) the price they're the ones who are pushing the market in the direction they want to push it you can't push it average retail Trader cannot move the market you just have to follow the price session follow the footprints and take advantage of the market moves so the second Angel unfailed no problem that's a part of my plan I have a double trap which is a high problem they set up a little more advanced but at two key entry points at the EMA and at the trend line so this is confirming to me that buyers are still buying a two key entry
(09:48) points great bullish bar I can go long and you can see you can make it all back quick easy scalp now we have a break of a spike on a channel which means I expect New Height to be formed okay because this channel is nicely confirmed and after break we expect most likely new high we can reverse anything can happen but I don't try to predict the future I just follow the price session and I trade the market I get not the market I want so we can see that we have smaller congestion this is what congestion is it is a series of
(10:14) overlapping bars stacked right next to each other without any killer Direction and generally you don't want to be trading congestion because there's a lot of whip solving back and forth back and forth and you want to wait for prices to break out of this congestion okay prices are pushing back above the EMA which is confirming our analysis that this option is going to get new extreme gray bullish bar and this is a high low confirmation setup and Market created new high now this is what we had strong bearish reversal down followed by a instant
(10:42) bullish push back above EMA okay so we can see that this is what sellers did and they didn't even manage to go all the way to the support they bounce in the middle of the train range and we are back above EMA again and now we have new low first attempt to sell pull back second attempt to self-felt with a very strong bullish bar so right now this is giving me information that the Bulls are still stronger in this market and I don't be thinking about selling above EMA in fact we can see okay prices keep pushing above EMA in a brand new series
(11:12) of high highs high lows and EMA keeps holding again so I need to once again count for long entries notice we have a new high for essential long second inch long horrible bearish bar fire from EMA and we have double trap can I take a double trap even though it survived I cannot why because I have downtrend in play if I want to go long the downtrend the bearish correction needs to play out that's the safest way how you're gonna make sure that your odds are increasing that the setup may work I want to see the Bears deplete first with the brake
(11:43) attend to Green you low and then I have high low confirmation setup EMA keeps holding and notice your stop loss was never hit once again one thick below the single bar very strong bullish push I have a brand new key entry point forming I have a new high for essential long second inch long a market kept pushing high of course here I would arguably drew a Downton or it could have been a little bit tighter at this point the bullish move is quite strong this trade can be skipped or it is more aggressive but this is what you do if you want to
(12:12) find the proper places where to enter on the chart because you cannot move the market you just follow the institutions you follow their footprint and every single bar is telling you something the brand new higher high and brand new higher low is giving you information where the market is going you're looking for key entry points you're not being emotional you're being patient and you just wait for Market to form as your Edge is dictating the only indicator I have on my chart is a 21 bar exploding to moving average the price session
(12:41) reflects human behavior it reflects human ingredient fear I don't need any volume profile order flow stochastic macd the price session alone can tell me everything I need to know if I just analyze it watch where the market is going and analyze every single candle it's not fancy as bunch of fancy indicators promising your Holy Grail but you should have at least some level of understanding what you're looking at and when the market is going it only makes sense to be aware and understand what you're trading what is the instrument
(13:12) doing and where the moves will most likely form that doesn't mean that you cannot use additional supportive indicators like we have on the right to help you while analyzing the price session of course any Trader can use and Implement different ways how to analyze the price session but you should have at least some sort of understanding what the price action is doing and where the price session is heading rules of price session work in all markets when I put different charts in front of you you're not going to be able to tell the
(13:37) difference between chart from today and chart from 10 years ago human nature doesn't change price action is a reflection of human behavior and it is in our genes we have three different charts but we can see there are all three different instruments and different time frames we have USD JPY 5 minute we have the SMP es or mini chart and we even have Procter Gamble the weekly chart and you can see there are similarities to all these charts because price session is still following the same rules in all markets and in all
(14:07) time frames you're going to apply the same logic of price action when you're trading every single different instrument your approach to the market should always be the same you should always look to mark your chart up you should always look for key entry points and for a high probability setup it should be a routine for you to be consistently marking your charts and looking for the proper places to enter we can see that we have first two swings that allow us to identify a possible key entry point and third swing confirmed it
(14:36) so the structure of this Market is bullish and I need to follow my plan I count from the each new high because I'm counting for high quality setup I have a second entry loan but is far away from EMA it is not at the key entry point which means according to rules I cannot really take it even though it work here next time it may not work we have double tap count reset and notice we have the two-legate pullback confirming the trend line downtrend played out and we have second entry long at the key entry point with a great strong bullish signal bar
(15:05) so this is where I'm going to decide if I want to enter how much I'm going to risk what is my target profit where I'm going to put my stop loss my stop loss goes always one thing below the single bar and why am I using stop loss because I don't want to argue with the market if my analysis is wrong I want to get out as quickly as I can take the minimal hit and look to re-enter on the next one for this reason I'm just gonna bet that my analysis is correct in case Market goes and stops me out then Market is probably
(15:30) reversing and I analyze the wrong so if it's all I get pulled back strong push above EMA and high low confirmation setup of two key entry points and you can see the price action is indicating to you that the market is losing steam is losing momentum prices are no longer making it all the way to the trend channel line but you can see they are barely making it to the midline so there's a loss of momentum every single detail is being told to you by analyzing pure price session we have a break of the channel which means we expect new
(15:59) extreme new high for essential on pullback second inch along two-legged pullback and the downtrend played out with the brake and new extreme so you can see the same rules we've used earlier can be applied on the USD JPY five minute chart and here you can see the es one minute chart we still have first couple of swings at the bottom allowing us to identify the channel the channel is getting confirmed here channel is getting come from here so I have my bias I have my key entry point and I'm just counting for high
(16:28) probability setup we have another two-legger pullback for essential long second inch long down Jump by that with the break new low add the key and always look for opportunity to buy when the structure is bullish wait for a setup that follows your Edge once I see Market working hard like this I'm not chasing the market I don't care that the market is going to have Market can go higher 50 20 points 50 points 100 points I don't care I can only follow my plan and enter while prices will pull back and will make their way to the key entry point
(16:58) another two-legged pullback another second inch long at the key entry point and another second and too long at the key entry point followed by a break high low confirmation setup and new extreme of the market was formed and I'm a scalper so I'm mainly interested in small price action moves this works in all time frames but I like to be in and out of the trade fairly quickly and I like the idea of being able to predict a very small move in price action you should always start by identifying the bias and identifying the key entry point
(17:28) that should be your habit that you need to learn it should be a routine you're not placing a trade unless you successfully identify what the bias is and where is the possible key entry point as you watch price session develop long enough you will develop a sense a gut feeling that will help you to navigate through prices easily and you'll be able to predict where the prices are going to go on a more reliable consistent basis but it takes time to get used to it you need to train your eyes to see the price action
(17:59) develop to see the candles print and Market moving you should apply the same Market approach to every single Market because the price chart is a map of interaction between buyers and sellers the first thing I'm going to ask is what is the bias we clearly see that it is a bullish Market structure which means I'm only looking for high quality setups to go long I have my key entry point and at this point on I'm accounting for second entries because I want to know when the high product is set up which is the two-legger pullback may appear the
(18:31) highest high to like a pullback and a second entry long form and two key entry point a market continue working higher you can see that there is a reason to price women and all these big moves happen at certain level and that is because in every single Market there is a push phase of the trend and correction phase the buyers have to take profits and sellers the beginner Traders especially are picking tabs trying to reverse the market but you never want to trade against the main Trend you always follow the trend and the best
(19:00) opportunity is to wait for prices to deplete the best momentum and then jump on Longs again so this is where the correction phase is ending at the very key entry point and a high probability setup appeared another second entry along with the breaking low of the downtrend followed by a high low but the horrible signal bar Market continues working higher and another two-legged pullback at the important key entry point a market continues working higher there is actually even a high low so you can see we went over three different
(19:28) price charts four in total and you can see there's still the same behavior to prices we have larger two-legger pullback market likes to move in pairs of tools and according to price session rules you're not expecting reversal just because you see this very sell-off that doesn't mean you expect from Market to suddenly reverse it can anything can happen but you're more expecting since it resembles to like a pullback still to expect new high especially if you have strong push above EMA which is confirmation of the Bush momentum then
(19:57) you know by this strong push-up of EMA multiple consecutive bullish bars the ladder bars are buying and the new high is most likely going to be reached followed by a high priority setup new low first attempt to sell pull back second attempt to sell that failed when you're trading you want to be patient you don't want to be over trading you don't be consistently looking for setups on every single candle instead you want to lay back let price action to develop in front of you and once you see price action approaching your key entry point
(20:26) this is where you start paying more attention because you've analyzed the context correctly you got your key entry point confirmed and now you see the setups forming this is where you start paying more attention if the single bar is good if the setup is congested or not think about it as your Predator just hiding in the bushes waiting for prey you're not running around consistently looking for every single setup and over trading because if you keep over trading if you keep mixing the rules if you're antsy to take a setup if you're
(20:51) frustrated you will never really progress you will be stagnating on the same place because you will never teach your brain to look for the same pattern to follow the price action rules to follow your trading plan you will never reinforce the good trading habits and trading skills and overall mental fortitude you cannot allow your emotions to get ahead of yourself you can't trade impulsively you cannot Rush trades you cannot overreact trading should be boring it should be mundane it should be a routine you really shouldn't be that
(21:20) excited when you have a winner and you shouldn't be upset when you have a losing trade this is all part of trading your goal is just basically try to follow the rules as best as you can and just bet that your statistical Edge in the long run eventually will be good trading is a skill like anything else and it requires practice you need to study and practice Traders are convinced that studying the charts after the fact that has no benefits but I guarantee you that almost every single profitable Trader you know study their charts after
(21:48) the fact they're back tested and think about this every single profession in the world basically starts with practice actors first use simulations and fake accounts before they start performing operations on live patients Pilots first get into simulators before flying real plane if you're a boxer you don't just jump straight into ring against another professional use par you train with heavy back Etc and basically trading is the same thing how do you practice well you have to take your chart and print it at the end of each day mark it out with
(22:17) setups look for patterns think about how you would have traded it would you could have done better how you would have drawn your key levels all these things you want to go through because with time you will start seeing more similarities in price session and quicker you will be to react studying your charts after the fact will help you speed the learning curve and you will be able to understand price action quicker you need to follow your trading plan training plan is important because most of the training is manual and we need to constrain
(22:46) ourselves from doing something we shouldn't do first you need to make sure you're comfortable make sure you're in a positive comfortable environment find what makes you relax and follow this routine but it is making a tea or coffee I make my tea every single day before every single training session at almost the exact same time it's basically become my routine the goal is to leave all the distractions outside because Traders especially scalpers they need to be in the zone as a scalper you need to be ready to observe every tick and to
(23:17) catch any little price movement sometimes you look away for 2 seconds and if Market is fast you miss a setup and you cannot afford to be distracted uncomfortable and frustrated all details in price action are important and that's why sometimes when I was starting out I skipped this very first step I came in late I set it from the screen and I quickly opened up the charts and I rushed my analysis why because I was too eager to trade I couldn't afford to miss one day and this often times led to me not being fully objective and not
(23:47) wanting to miss a setup and drawing channels too wide while ignoring a break in a new extreme resulting into a losing trade at this point I would never allow myself to do this again I was burned so many times if I'm running late no matter what I will not trade the first couple of minutes after opening my chart until I cool off and I'm comfortable set your goals and expectations now this is different whether you are a very beginner or already advanced Trader who is trading let's say micros yes or planning to transition live because
(24:16) beginners can afford to take more trades in order to learn about the price session and discover their Tendencies however even beginner Trader should plant seeds of the proper mindset and approach early because if you treat train like a job from the very beginning transitioning life is going to be much easier set your goals how many trades per day do I plan to take when do I take breaks if I don't find set up early when is my cutoff Point am I okay with not making any money today if I don't get a good setup all these things you need to
(24:46) be prepared because the last thing you want to do is you want to chase this set up at the last minute hoping you will make it up you have to have realistic expectations with time you will discover which routine fits you the most maybe you're tired for the day and you don't feel like trading Market is not good Arena to bring these feelings in when you have issues in real life perhaps just say to yourself I'm not in the right state of mind and I'm not going to risk my money and I will sit here and watch it just to get experience I will
(25:15) not trade but just watch the market just to get experience and after an hour you may discover you feel much better and you are in sync with the market I used to trick my mind in a similar way when I didn't want to go to the gym I was feeling tired didn't feel like working out so I just said to myself all right I'm just gonna go to the gym do some light exercises and go home I was trying to trick myself and lie to myself like that but when I got there I saw the people training I saw the atmosphere I suddenly felt pump and I got excited to
(25:38) actually do the heavy workout same thing with trading maybe you're just going to watch for a few hours and suddenly you will realize you're ready to take trades the goal is to recognize your state of mind and to be fully objective next proceed with the pre-market analysis before trading make sure you know what is the pattern and what is the bias ask yourself do I actually understand what's going on and sometimes you don't if you're fully objective you don't that happens a lot bias is not clear there are multiple patterns conflicting so
(26:07) just wait for the open for the market open and just follow the price action after the open it's important to be objective you cannot relay try to gamble or try to rush things it's very normal that there are multiple patterns working together you have conflicting beliefs so just wait it put the market open and eventually after the market open it will pick up and the analysis is much easier also have a predetermined plan how to deal with frustration after some time you will become familiar with yourself and you
(26:37) will recognize patterns when you self-sabotage it is Paramount for you to stay objective and true to yourself you cannot let your need to make money for this day to force you into doing something you shouldn't do after losing trade you may get very upset if that happens you need to take a break get up and walk away for five minutes and you will be amazed how clear the chart looks after such a small break it's really astonishing because those negative emotions are building up and you need to get out you need to take a break and
(27:07) once you come back you clear your head and you're able to follow the rules again much better and with ease and sometimes maybe too overly attached to wrong bias despite the market showing you different clues that the bias is changing this is also happening a lot you really don't want to admit that you've been analyzing a little bit wrong the market is giving you information that the bias may not be as you first analyze you need to be objective and for this reason small break here and there is absolutely crucial because that can
(27:34) kind of help you snap back out of the cycle and be more objective good luck with your Trading



(270) How to Find the Best Chart for Trading - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGULPdDOWbw

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video we will cover the methodology that will help you to find the best chart to trade and how to find the right time frame for every instrument to identify the best places on a chart where to enter and to take the best trades Traders use price action rules price action rules help us understand where the Market's going to go where are the key entry points and what is the high probability setup Traders use these price action rules not only for scal trading but also for swing trading and because price action rules
(00:29) are Universal we can apply these rules in every single time frame and in every single instrument why is this important well because High prity setups they take time to develop everything in price action must align and Traders many times struggle with patient they're jumping the gun they're taking setups they're way too aggressive or TRS are not that experienced yet and in order to avoid making these mostly male errors what shads can do they can add more instruments to their trading Arsenal and they can increase the chances of a high
(01:05) probability setup forming because if You observe more instruments and you miss a good high prity setup on one instrument you're not that bother with it because you know you got opportunity on other instruments the highy setup will form eventually we are going to cover how to find the best stick chart for every instrument because stick charts offered enhanced symmetry they provide provide more details and we have better insight into market dynamics how can Traders determine the most suitable time frame and Implement effective money management
(01:39) strategies tailor to each instrument this is what we're going to cover in this video so now that I decided the type of instrument that I want to incorporate into my trading Arsenal where am I going to start which chart to pick your first objective that you need to understand is that you want to trade a chart that offers plenty of trading opportunity but the chart is not too fast for you to make bad decisions or it is almost impossible to execute right trades or that there are fake outs so every Trader's objective is to identify the
(02:14) right time frame that offers plenty opportunities but it's not too fast or not too slow because if a chart is way too slow you're going to be waiting a very long time for a high probability setup Now High time frames are good to identify the overall bias and they are good for mainly swing Traders but you need to adjust to bigger stops bigger targets and you have to understand there are fewer opportunities you need to understand that the chart you're going to select needs to fit your individual personality and your trading style you
(02:45) need to be comfortable with the chart you're going to be trading on the right you can see we have 2,000 tick chart for the es and we have 10,000 tick chart for the es 10,000 dickart as you can see looks good is symmetrical key entry points are easy to find but it offers low amount of training opportunities and it's mainly used for higher time frame analysis the 2000 thck chart for yes is the perfect time frame that sculps use because it offers a lot of opportunities to trade it is a perfect balance but there are not too many fake outs and
(03:19) it's not moving too fast so it is hard for us to execute our trading decisions and this is the goal for Trader to have a chart that offers good enough opportunities but it's not too fast with impossible to execute correctly or there's too much clutter and noise on the chart for this reason you should avoid really trading a time frame that is less than 1 minute because there is so much noise it is very hard to execute trades properly it is moving too fast you're going to be making M errors and there can be a lot of fake outs how to
(03:48) select the most useful chart every single time I want to find the best stick chart for a new instrument that I want to trade the number one step is I need to find a thck chart that is most similar to one minute chart because one minute chart is optimal time based chart for sculping but I want to find Optimal tick chart because time based charts are not as symmetrical and they don't provide as many details so we have one minute chart for the GC Futures example Market moves in pairs of twos and I'm going to randomly plot thousand tick
(04:19) chart I need to start from somewhere now my goal is to find a tick chart that is similar to one minute chart and the step two is I'm going to be applying price action rules and I'm going to be looking for symmetry I'm looking for key levels I'm looking for if there is enough high probability setups and if there's enough fars overall so I'm going to be taking a look around these areas because I see a lot of clutter here a lot of clutter here and I want to see some nice probity set up at the key entry point following
(04:49) the price action rules so I'm looking for symmetry I'm looking there's enough bars and I want to see if there are high prity setups or not and how many of those High prity setups are there Market Moves In of twos now the Thousand tick chart looks okay but if I'm going to analyze the amount of bars you can see low amount of bars on the chart not that many trading opportunities if I'm going to select the 500 tick chart I'm going to go a little bit lower decrease the tick chart number you can see okay now we're talking a little bit more similar
(05:19) to one minute chart you can see more bars more trading opportunities why for example there is no lower high here I want to see some little pullback so this is what I'm looking for I want to find key levels key entry points I'm looking for high relity setups I'm looking for the amount of bars I want my tick chart to be similar to one minute chart if the chart contains low amount of bars with very few hypoy setups I will lower the number of ticks on the other hand if the chart contains many price moves and lot
(05:47) of fake outs I will increase the number of ticks so the 500 chart looks optimal for the GC example step five watch the chart for several days and confirm if you're comfortable and compatible with but you want to back test it you want to check multiple days to truly see if there are a lot of trading opportunities if it's not too fast or too slow apply this to any other instrument next instrument I want to add this CL for example to my trading Arsenal so I'm going to start with 200 tick chart but this sck chart as I can see has a lot of
(06:20) bars on a chart and has a lot of fake outs it is very hard to follow it is printing too fast it has a lot of small congestions I have no time to make the right decision all the bars are forming very fast when I'm watching this live this is Extreme sculping and this is not what I want to trade because there a lot of fake outs a lot of noise it is very hard to trade and this sck chart is simply too small I want to trade a chart that will get rid of the fake outs and I have time to make trading decisions I have time to place orders on the chart
(06:52) and I can analyze the chart properly so I'm going to increase the number of ticks let's say I'm going to go to th000 tick chart still the CL now this price action looks solid it is easy to follow I can identify the key entry point but when I analyze this chart closely I have very few entries very few High prity setups I have a lot of first entries I have very few second entries very few high lows very few F second entries this chart is good for high time frame but I don't have that many opportunities every single time I see a lot of first entries
(07:24) and I see entries far from the EMA this chart feels way too big because I'll be waiting a whole day for just one setup so now 200 tick chart is too fast and th000 tick chart is too small so I need to find the medium I'm going to lower my tick chart I'm going to go to 750 tick chart okay solid price action still easy to follow decent amount of setups but it still feels a little bit slow now this chart is already good to trade but I'm going to ask myself a question if I miss a setup are there other trades and by
(07:55) the way I'm not doing this only for one day I'm back testing several days so I can fine-tune the best sck chart and I can see that there are not as many setups in case I'm going to miss another setup if I'm going to lower it just a little bit just a tat to 500 thck chart this is the best thick chart to trade easy price action it is symmetrical there are no fake outs no congestions I can make decisions in time it is also offering me plenty of trading opportunities so I don't have to sit here the entire day waiting for a few
(08:25) setups enough time to make decision so 500 TI chart for the CL that's the optimal chart so these are the steps that I'm going to do if I want to find the optimal tick chart you don't want to trade chart that is too small a lot of fake outs too much noise hard to make decisions but the chart that is too big is also not ideal if you are intraday Trader and you want to find several setups not just very very few so this is the best optimal chart and here we have for example the dance deck as you can see at the bottom 1 minute chart 1500
(08:56) tick chart looks very similar to one minute chart it offers more details Market insights and it is more symmetrical so this is how we're going to find the best sck chart we're going to start with the one minute chart you're going to be tweaking the number of ticks and you're going to be looking for optimal tick chart looking for Price action rules if they're being followed you're looking for Symmetry and you're looking for the areas if there are highy prity setups or not a lot of beginner Traders they want to start trading micro
(09:24) Futures not regular Futures because they want to make sure they're not going to blow their trading capital while they are in their developing stage and this is very smart so in order for me to identify the right thick chart for micro Futures we're going to apply very similar steps but the number one we're not going to look for One Mini chart no you're going to select the main regular chart for the regular es instrument you want to follow using micro Futures so for example we're going to use the es2000 tick chart and 1,500 NASDAQ so
(09:56) these are the main charts we use for intraday sculping so if I want to find the best the optimal micro future Mees or mq tick chart I want to find a tick chart that is similar to 2,000 es and 1500 tick charts once again I'm going to tweak these tick charts I'm going to look for the ideal number and as you can see Mees 950 thick chart is very very similar to 2000 and mnq 2500 di chart is very very similar to 1500 di chart so in that way I can trade the micro Futures by being very similar to regular Futures chart once again increase or lower the
(10:37) amount of ticks if you want to find the best chart watch it for several days and make sure if you are comfortable and compatible with it we chose the instrument we found the best stick chart and now the last question is how do I figure out the proper money management strategy and do I have to adjust price action rules to each instrument you don't price action rules work exactly the same on every single instrument there is no adjustment you need to do you will still apply the very same price action rules but you need to adjust
(11:11) slightly your risk to reward and your money management strategy so for ES the main target profit we use for sculping is let's say around 8 to 10 tick that's the scul profit 8 to 10 tick scalpers profit is quite similar to one to one risk to reward slightly less the bars on average are a little bit bigger so that's already a clue that you need to understand if you want to find the best money management and risk reward on other instruments so what are the steps if you want to find the best risk reward ratio and you want to trade position
(11:45) size that is similar to how we trade the es what you have to do is you're going to plot the other instrument the selected TI chart and you're going to measure the average size of the bar you can even use the ATR indicator but you can also also do it manually you're going to select many days and you're going to back test and see how big those signal bars are for the hyperal setups because you want to start at first from 1: one restk reward ratio so you're going to go to a new instrument you're going to look how big the average bar
(12:18) size is and that will help you to understand what's going to be your target profit for each new instrument so for example we're going to take a look at the CL and if I want to understand what's going to be the optimal sculping Target profit I'm going to take a look and I'm going to measure the bar size of high prity setups because I want to understand what the average stop L is going to be so I have 10 ticks here 17 ticks 19 9 24 this a bit too big 16 19 14 and 10 and this CL was a little bit more volatile than normal these are much
(12:53) bigger than normal they are because for example other day is a little bit slower 10 ticks 10 ticks 11 12 8 and 7 so I want to find a good average number for optimal sculping position so you can already see an eyeball it it's going to be around let's say 15 14 ticks so every single time I want to find the optimal scalers Target profit for each new instrument I'm going to measure the signal bar size because I want to find what is the average size of the single bar I want to know how big the stop lus is going to be I I want to find a Target
(13:30) profit at first that's going to be similar to 1 to1 risk reward and then I'm going to make it slightly lower than 1 to1 just like es because on Es as we trade 8 to 10 ticks is just slightly lower than 1:1 you're going to observe Market's volatility and for the CL 500 tick chart for example optimal Target profit is 10 12 14 ticks around that and for Nasdaq 1500 dick chart it's going to be 10 12 14 points around that you don't have to follow this perfectly to the te there is absolutely no problem if you will tweak this number a little bit you
(14:04) will increase a little bit more or decrease a little bit more it is around this number for the es we use this guideline based on the ATR to adjust our Target profit based on the Market's volatility and how fast it is if you don't want this headache you can simply make your initial scalp being one to one risk to reward ratio only problem with that is that sometimes the signal bar is going to be way too big and your target profit may be way too big is not going to be a scalers Target profit it may be much much bigger but going one to one
(14:35) risk reward ratio on most trades is definitely a valid strategy as well before you're going to find the best scalpers profit or you can just use the one to restore rual the whole time and no matter what your stop loss always goes one tick above the single bar when selling and one take below the single bar when buying on every single time frame and instrument you're trading if you're going to add more instruments and more charts to trade make sure you're going to test it first to see if you're not being too overwhelmed if you're not
(15:07) missing setups and don't overdo it it's just an idea that can help you to look for more Hy prod setups in case the market is very slow make sure you're going to test it and it fits your trading style and personality good luck with your Trading



(270) Market Rules EXPLAINED - How To Count Entries - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNzCegosXu8

Transcript:
(00:00) learning to count entries is one of the most important skills a price action trader can possess and why is it so important well because market likes to moves in pairs of twos this is how market moves it is die down to human psychology and this two-legged move also known as a two-legged pullback creates a high probability setup two-legged move in other words second entry if we combine it with the proper key entry point is a high probability setup this is why counting entries is so crucial because we want to find the proper second
(00:35) entries under the right circumstances so if we take a look the most recent price action we always take into consideration the most recent price action the most recent price action the structure is bullish we are above the exponential moving average and we are creating a consecutive higher highs and higher lows this is just clear uptrend so we are looking for reasons to go long we do not argue with the trend we're looking for reasons to go long so we're going to count from this high why why we are going to count from this
(01:09) high because this high is the highest high of this entire move this eye is higher than this high is higher than this high and is higher than this high right here if i put this to the very right side of the chart this is what we would see and now it makes sense this is the highest high of the entire uptrend so when we're looking at the highest high this is where we start our count and we're looking to look for entries and entry is basically when the bar breaks the previous bar high just by one tick and don't worry
(01:44) about this i will explain everything and show you guys example so we have a highest high right here and we have a first bearish move down second bearish move down third bearish move down and neither above none of these bars we triggered higher yet only right here we finally got a one thick trigger above this bearish bar above this bearish bar high on this bullish bar so first entry long triggered above this bar with this bullish bar so this would be high first entry long and prices continue working higher and we didn't have a second entry why we
(02:18) don't have a second entry long here well because this high right here just broke the previous pivots high the previous swing high this high rate right now right here is higher than this high and it resets the count according to price action rules so we have to start counting entries over from this high right here so what do we have we have a bearish move down we have another bearish move down we have a bearish move down bearish move down bearish move down even though this is bullish we haven't triggered yet one tick above
(02:51) neither one of these bars highs these are consecutive parts working lower and lower we are just breaking the lows but we are not breaking the highs so the first entry long hasn't even triggered yet we finally have a first entry long trigger one tick higher above this bullish bar right here so the first entry long trigger right here and the first entry long of the previous swing trigger above this bar right here with this bullet bar and we triggered here one tick above this bar on this bullish bar and notice we are
(03:24) working higher we're working higher and what happened the same thing this high just broke the previous pivots high so i have to reset the count and start my count over again desire is higher than this high and this high so we have a move working lower working lower and we have a first entry about this bar this bar this doji looking bar just broke by one single tick above the previous bars high so this would be a first century long that failed because first entry is not a high probability setup remember price is making two like a pullbacks the
(04:01) second entry is was high probability setup so we have a first century long that failed and then we have a second entry long that triggered one tick above this bullish bar i'm gonna show you once again this right here on this bar just broke one tick higher on this bar so this is a first century long pullback second entry long this is a high probability setup because it is a two legged move at the ema which is a key entry point and also there is a trend line we have a first two swings confirm the trend line set up the trend line excuse me and
(04:39) third swing confirm the trend line so this is a high probability setup and price keeps making higher highs and what do we have here we're still in an uptrend so we're looking for more opportunities to go long we have a new high right here because this high right here and why this is a new high because we just created a high right here and we have a swing by one tick at least break below this bar right here if we didn't get the trigger one tick lower below this bar right here there is no swing and we keep going higher we keep going
(05:09) higher so the pivot always happens when we have a bullish move and a bearish move right after this we have to trigger below this bar low for the pivot to establish okay so we have to start out our count over so what do we have we have a move and a first entry long triggered about this doji looking bar and what happened we have a double top right here and hold on here is a special treat for you double tops and double bottoms reset the count so even though we have a first entry long right here we just created a double top to the very
(05:47) tick on this red bar so that means that we have to reset the count and start counting over and looking for entries from this bearish bar with the red body so this is a double top and we didn't create a move down we continue working higher but have we continued working lower we would have been counting from this this bar right here because the double top and double bottom resets the count price keeps making highs and we're basically resetting the counts over and over and over again now this high right now is higher than
(06:21) all the previous bars high and we just broke one take below this this bar right here one take below so this is a new pivot if i take a look if we take a look on the right side of the chart this is the highest high of this entire uptrend so remember we are looking for this pattern two like a pullback at the key entry point so we have a move down move down and the first entry long triggered above this bullish bar on the following bar this following bar just trigger one tick higher above this bar right here starting to get a little bit
(06:58) cluttered but don't worry it is not so hard hopefully it's the obvious first entry long because first entry is not high probability we have a three consecutive bearish bars working lower and here we have a first bullish bar and we still don't have a second entry long yet we're still working lower on this bar right here that broke one tick higher above this bar this just created a second entry along right here pull back first century long pull back second entry long right here at the two key entry points very high
(07:31) probability setup resulted in winning trades so this is how you count entries in a trend specifically in an uptrend in this example if we break the previous pivots high you have to reset the count and start counting over now what we need to realize is that we always take into consideration the most recent price action because if we for example take a look on yesterday's session and if you for example take a look at this high this high right here is clearly lower than these highs these highs right here than this high than this high
(08:07) but the uptrend started from this point on and we are always interested in the most recent price action otherwise we we would never get the proper count so the most recent price action where the trend is starting that's when we start counting and we pushed above the ema strongly so this is a good sign that the uptrend is starting and we have a first entry the trigger one tick above this bullish bar this is the new high pullback first entry is working higher and there is no second entry because now we are working higher now we are working higher
(08:40) and we notice how we don't have a trigger one tick below neither of these bars so there is no pivot there is no swing the swing occurred right here because we just trigger one tick below the following bars low so we have a final pivot and finally we can start counting from this point on this is the highest high because design is higher than this one and we have a just a first entry long trigger one tick higher above this bar i mean continue working higher new pivot right here and the first entry long percent wrong trigger higher so this is
(09:12) just a bunch of first entries now i mentioned that double tops and double bottoms reset the count and here is the example i'm just going to make it even more visible this eye right here is higher than all the previous swings this is the highest swing if you take a look at the right side of the chart this is the highest swing now we have a bearish move down and we have a first entry long because this bullish bar triggered about this bearish bar high and thus created a perfect double top so i have to reset my count over because
(09:53) double tops and double bottoms reset the count so i'm starting to count from this bullish bar so we have a first entry long that triggered one tick above this bar on this bar this bar trigger one tick above this bar so create the first century long now experienced price action trader can see that this is a two legged move and this is a hidden second entry long so i don't want you guys to be focusing on this just remember double taps and double bottoms reset the count but advanced trader can use his experience of studying the charts and
(10:29) can see that this is a two legged pullback and he can potentially treat it as a second entry if he deems so but the beginner trader only wants to focus on resetting the count same thing happened right here the price right now is in and downtrend and this is the first bearish lag that we are working lower and this is the first swing so we're starting the count let's now talk about starting the count in a downtrend we're starting to count from this swing right here so prices are working higher and this would be just a first entry
(11:09) short because we triggered one tick below this bar right here let me make it better excuse me rectangle right here we just trigger one tick below this bar and created a first entry and there is no second entry because this wing right here is lower than this swing we just broke this wing's low so we have to start out our count over if we are looking for reasons to go short this is the new low pull back first entry short and we are continuing working lower and here we have a pullback first entry short but what do we have we
(11:46) have a double bottom so we are starting the count over from this point on and remember this is a still downtrend and it remains to be a downtrend until the bar or the move breaks the previous pivot's high this is because this move right here didn't broke didn't break this pivot's high so this is still downtrend this move up here didn't break this pivot's high so this is a still downtrend this move up higher didn't break this pivot's high so this is a still downtrend and if we count from the top this is a first century long pull back
(12:28) second in too long pull back third entry long pull back fourth entry long and on this fourth entry long we just broke the previous pivots high so the downtrend is over and the bullish trend just started and since the bullish trend just started we're looking for second entry longs we're just pushed above the ema and this is the new this is the highest high right here this high is higher than this high it created the swing because we trigger one tick below this bar so this is the swing and we have a first entry long the
(13:04) trigger one tick above this bar push lower and a second entry long that triggered one tick above this bullish bar this is the first entry long right here and this is the second entry long right here and you can see two bearish legs working lower first bearish lag first century long second bearish lag second entry long and we continue working higher and also since we are pushing above the ema this is just a little tip we can use this opportunity to look for second entry short failures because the downtrend played out
(13:41) and we know the overall bias is up and we know there are going to be people chat going short and since we have a double bottom right here and we have to reset the count we have to start counting from this bullish bar let me just make it a little bit more clear we have a bullish bar right here we pushed above the ema and this is the first entry short pullback second entry short trigger bill of this bar so this is the first entry short pullback second entry short and it failed so this is a high probability setup we're looking
(14:16) for second entry longs with the trend at the key entry point and where we are we are in an uptrend we're looking for failed second entry shorts if we were in a downtrend we would be looking for failed second entry longs that's a little bit too complicated and don't worry about this this lesson was only about how to count entries with the trend


(270) The Two-Legged Pullback Master Setup EXPLAINED | Price Action Trading For Beginners - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4UFvxWB0AU

Transcript:
(00:00) what is going on traders welcome to my channel in this video we're going to talk about the most popular setup amongst the price action traders and it is the two like a pullback now it would be weird if market just moved in these v-shaped one-legged formation this is not how market really moves market moves with corrections that are being printed on a chart this is something like what it looks like in real life and the tool like a pullback is exactly what the name entails and it looks something like this the first bullish lag is just a
(00:34) series of bullish highs bullish bars making higher highs and higher lows and once the first bearish bar breaches this formation and creates a new low that is lower than the previous bullish bar low the first bullish lag is over and the first bearish lag begins bearish lag is just a series of bearish bars making lower highs and lower lows and once the trend resumes and the balls are strong and in control this the second leg starting to form it is a series of bullish bars making higher highs and higher lows now that is also
(01:09) what it's called a first and the second entry first and the second entry is nothing more than just a first or second attempt by the bears to reverse the market and change the trend direction if this is the first bullish lag and it's the first leg working higher first trend bullish uptrend the first attempt the first bearish bar that breaches this formation is a first attempt by the bears to reverse the market as it fails and market keeps working higher the second bearish bar that attempts to reverse the market is a
(01:41) second entry so we have a bullish lag working higher first entry working higher second entry short now why is this so popular and why does this happen about it this is tied down to human psychology when we fell at something do we just give up or do we study hard do we work harder do we come back and then try it again this is why the market moves in tools and why it is such a powerful setup now do we care about the foundation of why this happens no we really don't care about that all we care about is that it's making us money when
(02:09) novice trader first look at the chart he'll go nuts he'll go crazy he won't know where to buy bearded cell because there's so many lags working up and down up and down and it's really hard to recognize the two-legged move correctly but here's the key why the two-legged move is so powerful and such a powerful entry it is because we need to combine it with the key entry points key entry points are trend lines support and resistance lines and exponential moving average this exponential moving average right here this ema is a 21 bar ema and
(02:39) we use it as a supportive indicator let's go from the start and it will make much more sense as you guys will see right now the market started with the downtrend how do i know it's a downtrend because prices are making lower highs lower lows i draw this trend line this channel around this downtrend ema is pointing lower and prices are below the ema so we are clearly in a downtrend now why do i draw this channel and why are we looking for these channels which are key entry points it is because the trend line rules that is in price action after
(03:09) prices will break the trend line the traders will attempt to make a new extreme this will happen if prices break the trend line don't just look for reversal straight up wait for at least attempt to make a new extreme by the traders so as we have this downtrend working lower and we have a first break of this downtrend remember guys we just talked about the tool like a pullback this right here is first legged move working higher this is the first leg working higher we have three bars working higher and the first
(03:41) bearish bar we have four bars working higher and the first bearish bar that breach this leg so this is the first leg move higher and it is followed by the second leg working higher now the key entry points are important because that's where the high priority setups occur so we want to combine these two legged moves the second entries with the key entry point ema is one of the key entry points since prices broke this downtrend and i'm expecting for traders to make a new low i'm only looking for reasons to sell but
(04:10) i'm not gonna sell in the middle of nowhere i'm gonna sell at the key entry point and this is the first leg working higher pull back second leg working higher so the two legged correction played out and it's now safe for me to look for reasons to go short the second entry triggered below this bullish bar but remember we are selling so we want to see a strong bearish bar so this was the first bearish bar that prices triggered below first like working higher second leg working higher at the ema quick easy scalp
(04:38) here we have another instance we have a first leg working higher pull back second leg working higher now i'm only looking for these two legged moves when it makes sense when i'm expecting some sort of pattern at the key entry point i'm just not looking for two legged moves all over the chart no i'm only looking for two legged moves when i'm expecting a setup at the key entry point and as the as the highs here make a nice geometrical formation i found this bigger channel and this is why i'm looking for this first leg move higher pull back second
(05:18) left move higher once i see that the two legged move finished i know that it's safe for me to look for short first entry short pullback second entry short at the ema and there is a little caveat to this the two like there are two legged moves inside the two legged moves there's a two legged move right here and there's a two legged move right here but also this can create one single leg working higher and the second leg working higher so there are two legged moves inside the two legged moves but we're not going to complicate that to
(05:45) let it move right here two legged move right here at the key entry point at the key entry point now remember when i told you about the trendline rules when the prices will break the trend line there was going to be arenas of a new extreme so we have a two legged move that resulted in the break of a trend line i'm gonna show you guys this is the first leg working higher first bearish bar the bridge deformation and the second leg working higher sometimes the legs are measured sometimes they're not that's okay if they are measured it's
(06:13) perfect if they're not measured that's that doesn't matter so this right here is the first entry short pull second entry short second attempt by the bears to reverse this bullish trend working higher and this is a high probability setup as we've depicted in the earlier part of the video and we are expecting prices to make a new extreme this is why i'm looking for the two-legged move because we just broke this bigger channel and i'm expecting a new low so this is why i am i'm gonna show you once again this is why i'm looking for
(06:43) two-legged move and look what happened right here prices are broken lower broken lower but we didn't make a new low yet there is a strong support forming and there's a lot of buyers that are jumping into the market we're not interested in going long yet because the overall trend is down and we are waiting for a new low of this of this channel this channel was confirmed by the confirmation of here and here and here we have a second entry long failure but we're not going to talk about it right now once again prices are working lower i'm
(07:14) not measuring these legs working lower why am i not measuring them because i am not interested in buying i'm only interested in selling and i was measuring the bullish legs working higher there is no point for me to keep measuring one leg working lower second leg working lower that's not going to make anything for me we are at the lows at the support and i don't want to go short directly into the support so we're bouncing after at the support we have a first leg working higher pull back we have a second leg working high
(07:44) as the prices are starting to go sideways and we are starting to form a trading range remember i still keep that in the back of my mind i'm looking for a new low of this downtrend and i want to go short at the top of the trading range so what i'm going to do i'm going to once again measure the first leg put it here and here's the second leg but here we can see that the prices are working sideways there's a lot of dojis a lot of stems this is what it's called congestion and we don't want to trade this congestion the better setup here is
(08:11) to wait for a lower high and a nice bearish move down this easy scalp but this two-legged move up we would skip it because there's a lot of congestion a lot of indecision in the market but i'm just demonstrating their first leg working higher bearish lag second leg working higher and once again i'm measuring it because i'm expecting a setup at the key entry point which is this resistance because i'm expecting for prices to make a new low and remember guys when i talked about the trendline rules it doesn't just apply to
(08:40) these bigger channels it also applies to the shorter term ones as well this is why i have this all the shortened trend lines drawn here because it works as well for the shortening channels now price is finally made a new extreme of this bigger channel and after prices will make a new extreme according to price action there will be at least correction or straight up reversal but we just don't want to be buying without a reversal pattern but we also are not interested in selling yet because we already have a new low and the downtrend
(09:10) played out as the market keeps making lower highs and lower lows you have to switch your gears a little bit because there is something changing we're supposed to go higher we're not and we keep making lower highs and lower lows what it ended up being you would be able to only find this channel after this confirmation because you have a you have a confirmation right here confirmation right here and it works nicely now when price is made this confirmation there is once again first leg working higher we have this uptrend working
(09:42) higher we have a break and there is a second leg two legged move and there it is first attempt to buy the bears to go lower pull back second attempt by the bears to go lower this would be a second entry short at the key entry point but we're not trading high side hindsight this would be too hard to trade in real time once you see this confirmation you can also take the second entries in the opposite direction meaning if we are in a downtrend we look for second entry short tool like a pullback to sell but we also look for a lot of buyers to be
(10:17) trapped because a lot of traders are trading against the trend and they're going to be trapped on the wrong side of the market so we're also looking for the failed second entries to go higher it's still part of the two-legged pullback think about this this is the new high this high is higher than this high or desire so i'm counting my count starts over pullback pullback first attempt by the bulls to go higher this we triggered one tick above this bar and this bar made a new height that is higher than the previous one and it failed it's just
(10:47) the first attempt by the boost to go higher and it felt and it confirmed the downtrend we are still in a downtrend price is pushed below ema which gives more credence to the setup that we are still in a downtrend and a second attempt by the bulls to go higher first attempt pull back second attempt good place to go short because we're looking for two legged moves and but we are not looking to go long once again we are in a downtrend we're looking to sell and the same thing happened right here you have this two-legged move up second
(11:16) entry short but this would be too hard to find in real time once this high forms you find the trend line you have a new high right here pull back first attempt by the bulls to go higher pull back second attempt by the bulls to go higher failed think about it so many people are going along into this trend line to fail too like a move up good scalp same thing happen right here in this instance you just have a first leg working higher this is why we are not just selling we're not just selling this entry you could see and you could tell say to me
(11:49) that this would be a good scalp to take it is off the key entry point no it's not this is just first entry and the first entry can fail think about how first entry fell here even if you have a break at a new low first entries are not high probability set up so we have a first entry short but we are not interested in selling because we are expecting the second lag working higher something like this since there is a key entry point i'm probably thinking that prices will struggle to break below so what i'm going to do i'm going to wait for the
(12:19) two legged move in the other direction to fail for the felt second entry long this is the new high of this move first century long pull back once again below ema exactly this is what i want to see second entry long failure two felt attempts by the bulls to go higher into this key entry point failed we are in this downtrend and prices made easy scalp and once again we broke this channel so what is probably going to happen next you guessed it traders will attempt to make a new extreme so what i'm going to do i'm going to measure this first leg and
(12:53) i'm going to wait for the second leg working higher but we didn't get it and that's okay i'm not just ready to sell yet even though i'm expecting a break and a new low i'm not going to just sell we can keep reversing from here and keep riling up we have a double top right here and i'm going to wait for the same thing i waited right here i waited right here and i waited right here i'm going to wait for the felt second entry in the opposite direction pull back pull back first entry long we just triggered above
(13:22) this bullish bar felt pull back pull back second entry long we didn't trigger about none of these bars highs this was the first doji that we triggered higher so this is why it is a first second entry long and think about this once again we're below ema it is a good bearish pin bar in our direction and price is confirmed they're working to make their new low we didn't make a new low yet notice we are shy away from a double bottom so in case i'm still looking for a new low i'm going to do the same thing very high probability
(13:52) setup i'm going to measure this lag first entry pull back perfect measured lag to the second entry i'm going to mark just this bar right here and this would be a two legged move up first century short pull back second entry shot we have this trend line working higher that break and a new high so the trend line rules work even on the smaller time frames and we finally have a new low right here we created additional lag to new low and prices are safely reversing from here if you're watching at this point on it
(14:24) means you're enjoying the content so i would kindly ask you to hit the like button subscribe to the channel if you like to study day trading and remember guys the two-legged pullback is there and we're only looking at it one under the right circumstances at the key entry points you don't have to worry about two-legged moves when you're not expecting key entry point or a continuation of a trend so god bless everybody

Transcript:
(00:00) shadows in front of us we have 2000 tick chart for the s p 500 m in futures and as a price session trader my goal is to identify places on the chart where price will create a significant move and i can capitalize on this move in order for me to predict these moves i need to have a strategy that will help me to identify the spot on the chart in hindsight i can see that the structure was a bullish uptrend but how do i identify the proper places to enter when i'm watching this real time this is a pure naked price session chart in front
(00:30) of us what i'm going to do i'm going to make my job a little bit easier and i'm going to plot the 21 bar expunge moving average the 21 bar exponential moving average is a supportive indicator only it tells me the bias and it serves as a key entry point which means when prices will pull back that the key entry point is from our exponential moving average i can expect under proper conditions for price to bounce off the exponential moving average now that's not the only thing that i need to pay attention to as
(00:55) part of the strategy my goal is to take advantage of price action rules and wait for high probability setups on the right conditions at key entry points if you guys don't know what the price session rules are i made a video about five price session rules that you need to know you can go and check the video to make it a little bit more easier to understand now what is a high probability setup high probability setup it sounds simple but it's a two-legged pullback because market likes to move in pairs of twos to like a pullback at the
(01:22) key entry point at the trend line support resistance line or the 21 bar exponential moving average once price creates two like a pullback i expect continuation of the trend as a price session trader when i'm trading a naked chart my goal is first to identify the pre-market structure before i start trading and i can take advantage of the information that was provided to me from the pre-market structure the first thing i can see is that yesterday's session ended very bullish you guys can see ema pointing up and prices were creating
(01:52) series of higher highs higher lows and that price action was transferred into today's session as well ema keeps holding prices and we still keep pushing higher consistently so right now i have a bullish bias right from the get go what i'm going to do because i want to follow the trendline rule i'm going to draw my shortened channels in price action you guys can see we shorten uptrend break new extreme so i now need to draw a shortened downtrend like this and we have an overshoot for this channel now you guys can see this
(02:22) is the overshoot this is unnatural activity in the market why am i not making the trend line wider because i'm bullish bias and also it fits nicely at the very beginning and these are three big bearish bars very steep move when the move is very steep i tend to trust this as an overshoot so i'm not extending the channel i'm treating this as a channel with the overshoot and overshoot leads to break of a trendline or possibly straight up reversal so this overshoot is giving me more confidence to my overall bullish analysis and as
(02:54) price is creating break of a trend line and is pushing higher this is confirming that this is a bullish structure so i'm going to draw a shortened channel because i want to follow the trendline rule and right now i expect to get a two-legged pullback at the key entry point now a high probability setup can also be a fail to like a pullback that goes against the trend second entry short in a bullish trend under right conditions at the key entry point can be considered as a failure and i can treat it as a high probability setup now we
(03:22) have a newer right here i reset the count here because price created first century short second entry short so i reset the account after significant even in the market and we have first century short second entry short again remember in bullish structure so i treat it most likely as a failure if it make its way to the key entry point now we have a small little trigger right here but when i was watching this live there was no tick lower so i'm going to make this lesson as the prices were printing live otherwise the second entry short failure
(03:49) would be right here now notice what we have price is making its way all the way to the key entry point but at this point on prices are a little bit stacked and it's not touching the ema completely the body is very far from the ema but once we get a trigger above this bar right here this is the first bar of the second entry short trigger that we triggered above and this can serve as a felt second energy short so according to price action rules this entry is decent but it feels a little bit stacked and not perfect at the key entry point so it's a
(04:18) little bit advanced but notice as price action is pushing higher i have to make the judgment i'm going to zoom out and i'm going to judge the structure and right now we keep pushing higher so what i'm going to do i'm going to identify a larger channel because right now this is looking like a stronger bullish structure than it did initially what i'm also going to do since prices creep getting multiple lags to new extremes if i have a trendline that keeps creating multiple new extremes that means there's a probably a
(04:44) wider channel so i'm even going to extend the channel like this and prices are right now working higher but remember i'm following the price session rules so what is my main focus where is the high priority cell going to appear at the key entry point and what is the high probability set up a second in too long it's that simple the trend is bullish and i only want to take entries on a high probability setup i'm not interested in chasing the market all the way up here far away from key entry point so this is the highest high where
(05:11) i'm going to reset the count and as i'm watching the market i can see that the price is created first century long pull back lower and we have second entry long forming where at the exponential moving average also i see a micro double bottom and i have a strong bullish uptrend and this shortened option needs to get new extreme according to trendline rule so this is a two legged pullback first leg down second leg down it's simple but it works and this is the only setup i'm interested in and this is a high priority set up this is my first trade
(05:43) for the day it let me sweat a little bit because it took a long time before it eventually pushed higher but if you don't monkey with the stop your stop loss goes one tick below the signal bar and you cannot move the stop you do your analysis prior and after you enter you cannot crash the trade you can move your target profit you cannot move your stop loss the only way you can scratch the trade a break even is if the market goes into long congestion and in that case the market can probably break out in either direction after scalping out i
(06:11) was just trailing the runner below each swing because i want to stay in the market in case market rallies to the upside so portion of my position i was just trailing to the upside scalp is the main portion and runner is just a gravy just a bonus in case market is going higher a market was truly working higher so after too like a pullback high probability setup at the key entry point is my strategy changing do i approach market differently no i approach it in the exact same way and i expect for market to do the exact same thing so
(06:42) after prices are pushing higher and i always we set the count at the new high we have for example new high first century long second inch long but this second inch long is not at the key entry point not at the ema so i cannot take it prices keep pushing higher new extreme form this is why we set the count and we have a new high first century long second entry long and we have shortened downtrend that played out and once again this is a two legged pullback second inch long great bullish signal bar at the exponential moving average with the
(07:15) direction of overall trend this is a simple high probability price action setup it was good enough for a scalp market form a double top pushed lower now we have a new high and i reset the count again and we have a first entry long notice what we have still closing above exponential moving average confirming the trend is still in play and we now have a triple bottom triple test so this is telling me that this bottom is still holding but i cannot take this entry why because it's just a first entry this is just the first lag
(07:45) so that means there is a high likelihood that the second lag is going to follow and prices may create a tool like a pullback at the key entry point again and remember when you are in a strong trend with trend pullbacks are designed to look weak counter-trend entries are designed to look strong so it constantly tempts you to pick a top and not enter on a pullback with the direction of overall trend remember you never want to enter while the market is pushing higher like this you always want to enter in its exhaustion phase in its pullback at the
(08:15) key entry point so right now we have a new high we have a first century long pullback second entry long again two key entry points are holding and this is another high probability setup using a simple price action rule what can be a little bit worrisome is that you're close to this resistance but if i'm going to zoom out and i'm going to judge the structure how strong and clean option it is there's a really strong likelihood that the triple bottom will hold ema will hold and if it's a 2 like a pullback with such a nice signal bar
(08:43) that you can take this as a slightly aggressive entry now market key is pushing higher and uptrend is still in play remember i'm following the trend line rule so as long as this uptrend is without a break meaning close outside this option is still in play and my job is to focus on exponential moving average and on a high priority setup notice what we have we have a first century long but i'm not interested it's just a first entry long also we have a multiple bottoms right here so i can reset the count all the way down here first
(09:13) century short pullback second entry short failure this entry is a larger felt second entry short it looks like this larger visual two like a pullback first leg second leg down felt second entry short at this point we entered a ema hard mode which means every single touch to the exponential moving average will result into a bounce so you can consider this entry as a decent entry it's a little bit aggressive once the market is this strong and this is a clear up trend you can pretty much make a case for going long here but once
(09:43) again you're not focusing on different entries you just want to take second entry longs at the key entry point or failed second entry short that goes against the trend now as the market keeps pushing higher and i see structure like this and it's the new hybrid reset the count we have a first century long and that means there's a possibility for me to get a second in too long the same pattern it sounds too simple it looks too simple but this is how price session likes to move in pairs of two prices are breaking lower and we have first century
(10:10) long second inch long at the ema at the time i even drew a little bit channel what was my channel something like this potential spike and a channel that i had so smaller channel it was very close to getting confirmed another second entry long at the key entry point again signal bar is bullish structure is bullish trend and you can see that it resulted into a winning trade and today was one of those days but it was like taking a candy from a baby but once you get a day like this you need to make sure you take advantage
(10:41) of this day and you only need couple of these days during a month if you get two days like this in a month and you can catch few decent runners because it is not impossible to catch two good runners on a day like this i caught one very good run today a simple to like a pullback at the key entry point in this bullish trend is all you need for the day like this is the day that we long for rules are still the same i'm not picking top i'm not even thinking about selling structure is bullish i keep resetting the counts at the highs right
(11:11) now we have micro double top so i'm going to reset the count and we have a first century long i'm not interested this is just a first entry long we have a second entry loan below ema ema get bar decent entry a little bit more advanced when i'm watching this i expect still for price to push above exponential moving average but it is not happening prices keep pushing lower consistently okay so right now i expect for prices to make its way all the way to my key entry point i'm going to draw the trend line we have a new low form
(11:41) first century short pullback second entry short failure but we closed below exponential moving image when i was watching this had we closed above i would have liked entering here but second entry short form below and even felt second entry show didn't manage to push above ema to confirm the voice momentum this is big we still need to push above ema because this down training is new low so if i'm going to be gambling and taking along here i need to see push above ema it never pushed above ema in fact it created a nice
(12:07) juicy double trap and this entry is very tempting because this downtrend needs to get new low so you're following the trendline rule not only for the big patterns but for the corrections as well and this was really tempting trade i can almost mark it but i'm not going to because it is against the overall trend but once you see traders getting trapped like this such a great burst reversal bar and it's down to this new low you can figure the market is probably going to keep pushing lower at least to the key entry point now notice what price
(12:32) did we have a break two likes to a new extreme and what do i expect now i observe how ema is going to react and this uptrend right now needs to get new extreme because i'm following the trendline rule so i expect to get a felt second entry short above ema and i don't get it markets just keep pushing lower and keep pushing over consistently so that means i have to adjust and this downtrend is probably not the one because we have five legs to your extreme so what i did i extended the channel like this because i get multiple
(13:03) confirmation now off the highs and even off the lows up chinese new extreme yes there's the bigger pattern but big patterns corrections may take time so i need to let this downtrend play out first unfortunately i don't even get a good second entry short if i had a decent second entry short at the two key entry points because ema and trendline are running together i would have considered it but we never got it and notice what we have small little break moved to a new extreme and prices are right now pushing above exponential
(13:31) moving average this is what it looks like zoomed out and i expect for prices to create new extreme why not only because i'm following the trendline rule and the price session rules but also because technical patterns repeat over and over again this is may 23rd technical analysis patterns repeat over and over again price action rules are working we have an option working higher we have a first break for the uptrend and what do i expect i expect to get a new high downtrend played out with the break new extreme
(13:59) and after prices pushed above ema and ema confirmed the bush momentum notice we eventually received a new extreme same structure i expect for it to do the same thing upturned from the june strong uptrend break we expect to get a new high first i'm going to let the downtrend play out break new low and if prices push above ema and give me a reversal pattern i can enter long expect for prices to create new extreme push above ema confirming the bullish momentum first century short failure second entry short failure do i
(14:31) get a trigger here unfortunately i don't get a trigger above this felt second entry short so when i was watching this i'm expecting now to get a last hope and to get a second entry long a noticeable price created new high first century long pullback second inch long and once again when i was watching this live there was no double top there was one tick lower so there was a legit second in too long and right now i have a first century long second inch long ema keeps holding price the bigger channel still needs to get a
(15:03) new extreme and this right here is a second entry long at the key entry point and not only that it is also continuation of the felt second entry short but the second entry short failure could have been treated as in the golfing and it is still in play and it didn't get stopped out you keep your stop loss one take build the signal bar so you would have to ride this out now that this is a great engine because you would be entering at the very highs and you don't want to take an entry like that but it is still continuation of a
(15:31) felt secondary short and at second inch long at the key entry point this is my second trade for the day and unfortunately i didn't get runner because it came back instantly stopped me out and market eventually kept going higher and notice what you have again new high phone first century long second inch long first leg down second leg leg down to two key entry points but the signal bar is horrible this is a nice bullish body i want to go long above this signal bar is bad so i cannot go along here and i need to be
(16:01) patient now we have a break of the spike at a channel new extreme form so that means that right now we can get correction of possible reversal and notice what we have new high first century long pullback second entry long another two like a pullback it was good enough for a scout but after breaking new high i'm going to be a little bit hesitant you guys can see you barely got out market reverse to the downside now i'm going to zoom out like this and i can see that right now we are working in a sideways trading range but we still
(16:30) tread it up into this trading range so we're most likely going to break higher and the option still needs to get new extreme so i'm not really thinking about selling prices are pushing above ema so if anything i'm looking for felt second entry short new low first century short second entry short failure but it is way too big way too congested ema in the middle of these bars i cannot take it you guys can see you still would have survived because you keep your stop loss one tick below the single bottle but that doesn't mean this is a good entry
(16:58) it was too congested too big and i need to steal my hands be patient in the meantime i still expect for prices to create eventually new extreme for the major uptrend right now we're in the middle of the stream range and you guys can see there are no high probability setups once prices are in the middle of the training range in the no man's land i'm not interested because you can get chopped out and i expect for prices to give me at least a second long before we reach new highs but we already reach new high so i can expect correction or
(17:27) possibly reversal so i'm going to draw the shortened channel to the downside first century short pullback second entry short i can mark this entry it is off two key entry points upgram played out with the break a new extreme expect correction or reversal we push ball ema which confirmed the best momentum and we are coming from the range highs second entry short 2k entry point market continue pushing lower and we are at the close the two-legged pullback pattern seems too simple to be powerful but if combined with proper
(17:56) market conditions it can be a reliable high probability setup i'm going to see you next time

(00:33) stion is a language that is talking to you and if you learn to understand the language of price action you will get the upper hand and you will be able to understand where the market is going for that reason as price action Traders we know that there's always some form of a pattern and we need to find and identify the proper Channel now generally the way we identify the proper Channel and the way we confirm it the channel is confirmed with three touches so we have a first touch right here second swing and we have third swing confirmation
(01:03) first two swings will set up the trend line third swing will confirm it now this is important because as long as this channel this uptrend is in play We are looking for buying opportunities we are not thinking about selling we're only looking for hity setups to go long after we get a break we expect for prices to create new extreme that is because we are following the trend line Rule now but sometimes it can happen the market May form an overshoot now now break of a channel is break of the bottom trend line in uptrend and upper
(01:35) trend line in downtrend but overshoot is the break with the direction of the trend meaning overshoot of bullish channel is break of the upper Trend channel line now overshoot is an unnatural activity in the market and it can cause a little bit of a Mayhem sometimes overshoot can lead either to break of a trend line or straight up reversal now a lot of times when you have overshoot you want to be careful taking a high prity setup at the key entry point right after overshoot because it can generate strong momentum
(02:09) in opposite direction but sometimes and this not so common but it can happen overshoot may even create a brand new trend on its own it may create such a strong momentum that new trend will start all right so let's take a look at this uptrend we have in front of us because we have a short option working higher we have a break and new extreme form but prices keep pushing above EMA and we keep creating series of high highs and high lows so this can indicate to us that there's probably a wider pattern developing so we have first
(02:42) swing right here we have second swing right here and we have third swing confirmation so what I'm going to do I'm going to copy this trend line put it at the top and I can see how nice is getting confirmed here and how nicely it's getting confirmed here as well as as long as this uptrend is in play I'm looking for high prity setups at the key entry points High prity setup is a twole pullback at the key entry point okay but notice what happened prices broke the upper Trend channel line which is right now an overshoot and it can lead to
(03:17) break of trend line or possibly straight up reversal notice what happened in this scenario we straight up revers into a brand new downtrend now this is not common most of the times eight or nine times out of 10 big uptrend like this after break of the channel will create new extreme okay for that reason once you see pric is having a break of this channel you expect for prices to create new high you're not selling just yet only after the prices have moved quite far down and it retraced a large portion of this uptrend that's when you
(03:53) potentially can start thinking about selling the market so once prices fell to push above ma here and push down this is where I identifi and I finally came to acceptance that we're not going to create new extreme but this is rare eight or nine times out of 10 you will truly create new high for the reason once I was watching this I was expecting to get felt second entry short above EMA and continue to create new high but this is what overshoot can sometimes create it can create break for sure or straight up reversal and notice what happened we
(04:24) got a brand new downtrend once again confirmations at the top confirmations at the bottom massive overshoot down now this is such a steep brand new downtrend that a lot of times there can be a brand new downtrend form so when I was watching this I even tried to find possible downtrend like this but even this steeper downtrend has overshoot right here so once again it can lead to straight up reversal or it can at least break the channel and notice what happened once again we didn't create a retest for a new low we
(04:57) have overshoot into bullish uptrend so another scenario but you guys can see it's important to talk about this it can happen and these overshoots it is a natural activity it is way too oversold and it will create strong momentum in opposite direction and our last example we have three overshoots during today's session uption working Higher One swing second swing third swing confirmation fourth swing confirmation just going to copy it put it at the top nicely fitting Channel and prices created and overshoot which means I got to be le about taking
(05:30) Longs because what can happen it can generate strong momentum in opposite direction break the channel now notice what we have here we have a d working lower with the break new low formed you still expect new high for the uptrend and notice new high has been reached now take a look at this example right here and I'm going to show you guys example of similar structure from March 25th all right so here we have the chart from March 25th and you guys can see almost identical price action structure we have confirmation here confirmation here
(06:03) confirmation here it is nicely fitting off the highs as well so this is a bullish uptrend we form an overshoot and notice what we have leads to a break of a channel downtrend working lower created a break move to New Low and after that we expect for prices to create new high following the trend on rule overshoot generated strong manap in Direction and prices still created new high because this is what is mostly going to happen and notice almost identical example overshoot these two break of a channel a new high has been
(06:37) retested right now we can correct so we had example of three overshoots and you guys can see how they can mess up the trend line rule because it is too strong too oversold to overbought and you can expect push in the opposite direction let's now take a look at the structure and let's analyze the high probability setups because we started with big news event which created a caused this massive selloff I first found this channel working lower that needed a break new low but lot of times such a massive selloff will create strong
(07:10) momentum and kind of like a wider downtrend so just to be on the right side of the market I still followed this wider downtrend now notice what we have we have a break of the channel new extreme formed which means from this point on I'm not looking for shorts just yet notice I have a new low first entry short pullback second entry short first leg up pullback second leg up this is a two leg up pullback second entry short at the key entry point at the EMA this would be a high probability setup but right now since down TR had the break
(07:42) and new low I need to be careful for me to safely resume the downtrend I need extra confirmation and I need to take a lower high so we see second entry short and we see lower high now technically this is not a lower high because it form micro double top but I'm calling this a lower high because it is very close and you can basically treat it as lower high technically is still continuation of the second entry short but there is absolutely no problem treating this as low high right now we have confirmation of second entry short and this was my
(08:13) first trade for the day nice bearish bar notice the triple test small resistance up TR plate that with the break and new high indicating that the buyers are over and I'm not only drawing the main patterns I'm also drawing these trend lines for the small look Corrections now after that we actually have Micro double and we have additional push and additional the true lower high so I'm going to mark this setup I don't want to confuse you so this is technically the continuation of the second entry short and then we have lower high the true
(08:43) lower high because this high is lower than the prior bar but you guys can see EMA keeps holding prices and at this point on bias is strongly bearish and we can now resume the sells even though you have a new low you don't want to take the second entry short just yet now after that market went into consolidation small the trading range and we strongly reversed higher so once you have a new low and you're strongly pushing above EMA I need to adapt to structure so once we are already up here I need to identify a brand new channel
(09:15) and like I mentioned at first I would be only watching this channel right here and we have new high first entry long pullback second entry long you guys can see this is a twole pullback on the largest scale new high first cental long pull back we actually have a take higher here when I was watching this live I Had No trigger Above This bullish bar and now that I reloaded my data I can see that we have a new high first entry long second entry long already right here but when I was watching this live I hit my
(09:45) second entry long all the way down here because I didn't get triggered Above This bullish bar so I treated it this as visual first leg down pull back second leg down if you had trigger here and you enter this I can see why you're a little bit closer to these highs and it's a little bit feels like at its high because the second L may follow but if you took a chance right here you follow the rules but like I said I didn't have trigger here interesting that that now that I reloaded the data I actually get a trigger right here but there was no
(10:12) trigger at the time so I'm playing this as a new low second entry long right here but this second entry long is below EMA and is a doge bar but notice it is a visual tole a pullback so this is a and downtrend has a break and a new low indicating to me that sellers right now are not in control and notice is what we have we have additional trap and a strong push above EMA big bullish bar after this to like a pullback so this is a great hyper probity setup close above EMA strong bullish signal bar and right now from this perspective I have a break
(10:46) and a new high form so I need to be patient for that reason I cannot just take a second inch long this is not marked as a Hy setup even though chances are that you're probably going to push higher but for the same reason just like here I want to see confirmation high low because once you have a breaking new high you can get trapped on a second entry long great thing here is you have a break and new low and notice another first leg down second leg down so this is the high prity setup this is how it looks like Market likes to move in pairs
(11:15) of tools but once this seconden loan works and it confirms the trend line just going to copy put at the top you guys can see you have a high low confirmation of this twole pullback indicating that the bullish momentum is strong it is at the EMA it is bouncing off the trend line decent high probability setup now the structure is bullish following the rules only looking for Longs but from that point on we didn't really touch exponential moving average here we have another second entry long but it's far from EMA you can
(11:47) easily get trapped then you get another second entry long to like a pullback but too high no room here directly into this trend line you don't know that it's going to create overshoot so this is not a great entry then we have overshoot which we talked about which means you don't want to take a second entry long after that plus you're not even touching the EMA so you guys can see follow the short and downtrend you can definitely create break and new low because it can lead to break of a channel prices are pushing lower you have a shorten break
(12:18) new low of the downtrend and at this point on I expect still new high for the uptrend so I'm paying attention if I get F second entry short above EMA but I never get F second entry short above ma now the correction may take a little bit longer so once we created this like down and we attempted to push higher again at this point on I'm still expecting for prices to create new extreme because this is the main pattern and bigger pattern is taking precedence the shorten Corrections shouldn't be so significant but once it rejected prices here again
(12:53) the exponential moving average this is where something is starting to be wrong here and at this point on the last rejection and the downtrend started so a little bit unusual but it can happen occasionally where you will not retest new extreme even when the uptrend is this strong right here but I don't think it is safe to go short especially on a bunch of first entries while the uptrend is still in play for the most part you didn't even get a good second entry short or low high none of that stuff now we have strong overshoot this is way
(13:22) overdone way oversold we have new low formed first entry short pull back second entry short now you don't want to take second entry short right after overshoot but you can take lower high or higher low after the second entry because even during overshoot because that can confirm the second entry short so I this was my second trade for the day lower high after the second entry short you guys can see they tricked me the overshoot was way too strong we didn't even manage to create scalp it was a little bit of a correction prices
(13:53) needed to create break new high before eventually pushing lower I was a little bit frustrated that this trade didn't manage to get the scalp I was almost having a perfect week and they got me right here but it was still decent trade to take a chance on if you look at this like this lower high confirming second entry short the overshoot was just way too strong in this instance but this is a small bar then you have a break in your high had this bearish bar close below EMA I would have lik going short here then you have
(14:19) a lower high but it didn't take higher if we ticked higher Above This bullish bar it would have been great lower high to still attempt to create new low but no real great setup for us to take a chance and right now something is starting to change we are not breaking lower new extreme is not being formed we are starting to go sideways we have new high and we have first leg down pull back second leg down and after this twole pullback bounced and pushed above EMA this is right now confirming the channel so right here you don't want to
(14:54) take a second or too long just yet because there's a still possibility that this down May create push down but once it bounced above EMA Hyo confirmed the second entry long even the visual to like a pullback what is going on here this is where you can go long and Market kept pushing higher we already talked about the overo what it can cause we have another high low after second entry long when I showed you the example from March 25th I actually took the high low on that day and I remember barely scalping out so for that reason I didn't
(15:26) really like marking it because you really never know where it you're going to make the a TI scalp during overshoot you're kind of playing with fire this option can create and will most likely reach new high for the most part you will probably create the break so you want to be careful strong rejection down break new low indicating to us the downtrend is over so notice I'm just following these short and trend lines and notice how price action is following these channels after we have a break in new low right now you're watching for
(15:57) push above EMA because push above EMA will indicate resumption of this uptrend and opportunity to take a high probability setup high probability setup is either second entry long or F second entry short above EMA here you get a f second entry short below EMA you get a high low below EMA so this is an area where you figure you're going to most likely push higher but never really get the good chance then we bounce above EMA again and we for new high first entry long second entry long first leg down pull back second leg down this is a two
(16:30) leg pullback there's a small little quadruple bottom that is holding so this is a f second entry short new low first entry short second entry short failure and a second entry long two high prity setups in one not the easiest setup to spot but one of those setups where you can take a chance because it's to like a pullback even the F second entry short support is holding and you expect to get new high for the uptrend only after price is pushed above EMA and resume the bullish momentum this is where you're getting the confirmation that the
(16:56) structure is strong and you have new high formed first entry long p back second entry long tole a pullback at the EMA at the key entry point you expect new high to be reach just like in this example and decent High prod set up before Market close interesting structure today you can definitely make a case for me marking a couple more setups slightly more aggressive overall very interesting that overshoots played such a major role that they managed to completely reverse the market almost every single time only this overshoot
(17:28) finally follow the trend line r after creating the perfect new high other than that these overshoots can be a little bit tricky but right now you know how to handle overshoots in the future so I hope the video was helpful educational I'm going to see you guys in the next one take care everybody

Transcript:
(00:00) most traders spend their time analyzing technical or fundamental analysis and though these are very useful they don't determine long-term consistent success long-term consistent success consists of three steps unfortunately most traders are interested only in picking the right spots on the chart to enter it limits the number of trades and without implementing the proper money management and trading psychology the long term consistent success is going to be hard to achieve you can have the best strategy in the world but if you don't
(00:30) handle losing trades properly if you don't size your positions properly in that case you become highly vulnerable when the market goes just few points against you it's important to understand for trader that in trading business losing trades are part of trading you're going to experience losing trades as a developing trader especially you're going to experience a bunch of losing trades and it would behoove you not putting unrealistic expectations to achieving high win percentage 90 95 plus win percentage is extremely rare and
(00:59) only happens the best of the best traders and even then you're most likely not going to be able to make the exact trading results everybody's mental makeup is different everybody comes from a different background everybody's trading journey is completely different and you cannot mimic others traders results everything starts with one single losing trade because if you're not able to handle losing trades properly if you don't fold the rules of your strategy and your money management system doesn't matter how successful the strategy is if
(01:31) you don't follow the plan for that reason you need to find a way to find losing trades acceptable by making proper position sizing a lot of times trader experience multiple losing trades in a row and they think themselves that they need to make it up so much to get even break even that they might as well just keep going keep digging i might as well blow my account and start over and this happens often traders a lot of times blow their account like this because they don't have predetermined set of losing trades when they're
(01:59) stopped trading for the day and they live to trade another day don't blow your heart and capital on a one single day this is a common boom and by cycle when traders make seven days consistent profit small little profits and they give it all back in one single bad day then they make weak consistent profits and they give it back on one single day boom and bus cycles nothing to do with the strategy accuracy even traders they blame the system it has nothing to do with the system nothing to do with the market market is not against you you didn't
(02:27) handle losing trades properly you probably got tilted and it resulted in blowing the account number one way you're going to protect yourself is you're going to select the proper amount of capital you're willing to lose the risk capital is the amount of money that you would be comfortable losing and if loss would not greatly affect your current financial situation a lot of traders find a fancy strategy on youtube and they instantly picture themselves creating a lot of money they don't even take into consideration the possibility
(02:53) of blowing the account your starting capital should be only a small part of your net worth that means you should not be borrowing money from your family you should not be withdrawing the savings accounts it's not the money you pay to rent with and that's the money you repair your car or buy groceries it's only the money you saved up on the side that you don't care about if lost before you go live first you need to prove your profitability on sim you cannot go live unless you've proven you can create a consistent money for a few
(03:23) months on the simulator you don't have to do it for years but you for a few months at least you need to prove you can do it consistently a lot of traders they jump in too quickly thinking that they're ready they're blowing their hard earned money and it would be better off if you just waited a little bit more been a little bit patient and then saving the capital once you're ready to trade live what should be the starting capital for a scalper of s p 500m in futures i would recommend twenty five hundred three
(03:51) thousand dollars you're going to have enough funds for 2025 trades some traders recommend starting with 10 000 and it would be great if you can acquire that amount of money to start with you're going to be risking only one percent per trade but this is enough money for you to have enough funds for 20 25 trades you cannot start with 1 000 account even though margin is 500 you're going to take few losing trades you're going to be approaching the 500 dollar margin call and they're going to affect you psychologically and you're not going to
(04:21) be able to make money you're going not going to be able to recognize the proper opportunities in the market you need to have room after you're losing trades you need to be comfortable and psychologically stable if you're going to blow your 3 000 account what makes you think that you're not going to blow a 10 000 account if you can't make money within 30 trades and you're going to blow your 3 000 account that is for sure obvious that you're going to blow 10 000 accounts save your money if you can't make money
(04:48) with account like this go back on simulator prove your profitability there after a few months come back and try live common rule in trading is that you should be risking one or two percent of the capital per trade and this is the ideal scenario you can risk a little bit more but you just have to make sure that the total dollars at risk are within your comfort zone you cannot be risking 20 or 30 of your capital per trade would you be okay with losing 60 of your beginning balance on just three losing trades you wouldn't and yet a lot of
(05:17) beginner traders approach trading like this i started like this i started with little over a thousand dollars i thought it was nothing i'm okay with losing this i thought i was going to make few winning trades right off the get-go so i have a little bit of a cushion what ended up happening i had a two losing trades my first trades life were two losing trades and i instantly realized how close i am to the margin required i easily realized how low uh amount of trades i can take before i can close my account and that of course affected me
(05:45) psychologically and if you are worried about losing money that will affect your trading and you will lose money you have to trade so small the one single losing trade is completely insignificant trading is not about trade by trade basis it's about series of trade you have to risk small you cannot get shaken by one losing trade if you feel any sort of jitters after you lose one trade that means you're trading too much or you're too much emotionally invested every trader should limit the number of trades per day they take and limit the number
(06:14) of losses per day if you take two losing trades in a row take a break take on 15 minutes clear your head get back if you take a third losing trade close it for the day it's not worth it keep pushing it because a lot of times you will close it come back next day market is going to be easy it's give you easy setups you're going to be in the zone you're going to make all the money back and then some and you would be saying to yourself wow i could have blown my account so easily had i just waited one single day
(06:40) that happens a lot it's never worth keep digging the whole i know that a lot of traders they have a few losing trades and they think to themselves that it takes so long to make the money back that they might just well boil the account and start over again no with proper money management system we're going to talk about if you have good risk to reward ratio you're going to make the money back easily you need to limit the number of trades per day you take as well you cannot be too greedy it's about finding the balance if you
(07:03) have two or three winning trades in a row i recommend calling a quit for the day and on a high note if you have three pre-winning trades in a row and you take one losing trade you're probably going to take take even more trade because you picture yourself with a 3-0 winning date and you take one losing trade so you want to make a little bit more money and if another trade is a losing trade again you're getting close to break even you're getting now completely frustrated had you just start with 3-0 that would
(07:29) have been much better every single time you place an order in the market you're exposing yourself to risk if you are 2 or 3-0 for the day don't push the luck no more of course if the day is extremely easy trend day or you can read the price action correctly of your of course if you're advanced trader you can take a little bit more trades but most traders are better off if they just don't be too greedy and take their money and start trading next day always set the stop loss stop loss protects you against yourself by putting
(07:57) stop loss in the market that tells you about yourself that you're accepting the possibility that the trade may lose by every single trade place in the markets there is a possibility that this trade may lose and for that reason you need to accept the risk and put the stop loss in place stop loss should always go one tick below the signal bar and you should never move the stop loss if you keep moving the stop loss what does that tell about you that means that you're refusing to admit you're wrong you're afraid of losing the money and taking
(08:30) the hit now you want to give it a little bit more room for pullback so you can ride it out and the market goes in your direction that never works you will blow your account like this that's a horrible money management system you're going to need 10 more trades to make make it up on one single stupid losing trade always set the stop loss order never move the stop loss order and let the trade play out if you have a losing trade you'll learn from it and you start it from it traders should place their stop loss one take above or below the
(08:59) signal bar they're entering the reason because is using the price action structure that helps you protect the stop if the market reverses on you your stop loss gets taken out and you made the back call you're going to make it back on the next trade you cannot move the stop loss you cannot tweak it and put it in the middle of the bar because there's going to be a noise there's going to be a pullback and you may get stopped out prematurely even though the trend ended up working so on the paper you lost money but when it
(09:24) comes to strategy accuracy your strategy produce a winning trade bad money management system is going to make you lose money even though the strategy accuracy is working on your side you always put the stop loss one tick above or below the single bar what to do if stop loss is way too big and you're uncomfortably risking that amount of money scale down a number of contracts do a number you are uncomfortable with risking or you can use limit orders energy close and further back into a bar this is the advantage of the minorities
(09:52) you can decrease your stop loss or you can also increase the possibility of your target profit being hit if you trade regular es take the setup on microammonies in worst case scenario you can skip the trade but if you skip the trade always mark the setup always picture yourself taking the entry you want to get the experience you want to picture yourself taking those setups according to the strategy always mark the setup and act accordingly as if you would have taken that trade when can traders exit their positions early
(10:21) beginner traders should never exit early from their positions beginner traders should always let the position run if it's a losing trade learn from it because you don't have enough experience to recognize that the market context is changing and a lot of times beginners they exit their positions and the trade ended up working and they're making their learning process even longer that way never exit the position early if you're being a trader advanced traders can exit early when it's a congestion or consolidation period
(10:50) if you enter about this bullish bar this is your entry you put your stop loss one tick below because you don't want to move your stop loss you can get started on the noise after one hour of market not giving you clear direction this is a chance for a trader to pack his back take the money at break even and not risk anything because if market cannot make a clear decision where it's one to go within one hour that tells you that anything can happen in the market it can break out at either direction and your first intention your first analysis was
(11:23) a little bit off money management for scalping trader scalp trading is about taking multiple trades per day for a brief period of time swing trader can make money on 50 win percentage because he cuts his losses quickly and he lets his profits run as a scalp trader you're quickly in and out of the market with small profit and you don't care about the direction afterwards there's a huge advantage that you don't have to predict the market consistently you can be just right for your small tiny position and you're out of
(11:52) the market with your profit what is the minimum scalp size in stock should be 10 cents in es should be one point and forex should be 10 pips however your goal is to always have one-to-one risk to reward ratio a lot of times in scalping this is hard to do a lot of times you risk two to get one but if you risk two to get one or three to get one you're going to have insanely high win percentage which is going to put a lot of pressure on a trader the goal of a scalp trader is to find the perfect balance between being quickly in and out of the
(12:24) market and not leaving a lot of money on the table you cannot afford to take microscopes you're going to get kicked on the commission's you're going to have one losing trades that will wipe out 10 winning trades institutions can afford to sculpt one or two ticks regular retail trader most likely cannot why do i scalp for two two and a half points in yes starting out i used to sculpt for one point because this is the most commonly recommended target profit but i ended up having days like this i had three winning trades i took four ticks on one
(12:55) sold 12 ticks winner i took one losing trade it was slightly larger than the average 8 to 10 ticks let's say 12 ticks and i ended up being break even even losing money because of the commissions so i was being 75 right for that day so the strategy is clearly working but i'm not making any money if anything i can't even lose money on the commissions and that put immense amount of pressure on me because if you have this happen what will that do to you if that you will be forced to take the next trade you will
(13:25) jump the gun because you want to make the money back if one losing trade can wipe out your three winning trades you will be forced to take the next trades quickly because you want to make the money back that you already made and it will force you to take developing trades trades that are not even there also this will make you fear losing trades tremendously as a trader you have to accept the losing trades it is inevitable trading has an element of randomness patterns repeat consistently but not on a trade by trade
(13:53) basis and if you're afraid of losing money that means that you're going to skip the setups and you're going to only take the setups you think they are the best but if you're afraid of losing money you will end up losing money so the pressure is immense so for that reason when i adjusted my target profit to approximately reach to one to one to risk raw ratio i knew that if i have a one losing trade it means completely nothing i can make the money back and then some on just one single winning trade and that put me in a zone
(14:22) tremendously i don't even think about losing a trade losing trade just part of trading it's completely fine with this also if i had i used to backtest it and i figured out if i follow my strategy perfectly if i take the high probability setups at the key entry point the ease 95 plus at least easily work for 8 to 10 ticks and as the scalper your job is to find the balance between being quickly in and out of the market and not leaving money on the table so i didn't want to leave money on the table also you increase the chance of catching
(14:54) a runner because a lot of times if you hit one point target profit the market will pull back take your runner out and then continue in its direction but if you make your target profit a little bit larger you will ride out the pullback your runner is still alive when traders are afraid of right off the bat going for eight ticks great transitioning phase is starting for six tick target profit because if you're used to sculpting for one point and right now you find yourself sitting in a trade for a long period of time a
(15:24) lot of traders they can't handle that they want to exit the trade quickly they want to take the profit quickly and this is why a lot of traders don't like really increasing their target profits because they're too anxious they want to take the profits now they want to sculpt quickly and the longer they wait in the market they feel like the odds are higher there will not make the profit this works short term but long term on consistent basis you're better off having a one-to-one risk to reward than going for four ticks of course if you
(15:54) have high enough band percentage you're a great trader you can easily go for one point it all depends what suits your mentality the best but most beginner traders are going to struggle to keep consistently 75 but with proper money management and the proper risk to reward ratio you can make consistent money with six stick or eight tick target profit and if you trades other market than smp 500 many futures how do you identify the proper target profit well you can use atr indicator or you calculate the average stop loss in
(16:26) the markets and you will try to make the risk to raw ratio close to being one to one here's a recent trade that i took second entry short of two key entry points buy only went for sixty target profits because i wanted to have enough room to these lows so price broke lower filamentary limit order instantly pushed in my direction and i made quick easy six ticks well this is a perfect scenario isn't it well it's not this is very short-sighted because what ended up happening had i gone initially for my eight ticks
(16:55) i would not have been filled on the one single bar like this on a six sticks i would have to write this out i would have to endure the discomfort but what would have ended up happening i would have made the eight tick target profit right here and my runner would have survived because this is the initial entry and you put your one swing contract your runner at the break even position you guys can see the breakeven position wasn't hit so i ended up leaving 11 and a half points on the table and this is what i mean
(17:25) scalping for small profit sounds good very shortened but in the long term if you go for eight to ten ticks and you incorporate the runners your runners have much higher chance of surviving with the eight tick target profit because you will not get stopped out on the initial noise course it all it is subjective and it all comes down to your mental makeup if you can make money consistently one point it obviously suits your personality you're great and handling this great stick to this this is just my opinion what helped
(17:57) me as a developing trader you want to start with one single contract and after you've proven you can consistently create profits you can start adding on more and more eventually you can divide your positions into twos two thirds of the contract size is going to be your main portion your skull portion and one third is going to be your runner you're going to maximize the profits the most because as a scalper you're mostly interested in short term profits you're not predicting the market what's going to do in hours for now you're just
(18:23) interested in quick easy profit but what can happen your entry can produce a substantial move in the markets and you don't want to leave money on the table and for that reason you're going to leave one position open you're going to scale out so you can capitalize on the potential profits we're going to finish off with comparison between stop and limit orders and why i only use limit orders stop orders will allow you to never miss an entry and this is a great great advantage because on limit orders as a trader you need to wait for price to
(18:53) tick one tick above or below your setup you need to wait for the tick for the trigger because the market may reverse and the entry may not have ever triggered so you always need to wait for the trigger then you need to wait for price to come back and fill your limit order and of course it can happen the market will rally in the direction and it will leave you behind that can happen it suits my mentality the best that i'm okay with missing an entry what i like doing more because limit orders will allow you to decrease the risk the
(19:25) further back you place the rim in order the smaller your stop loss is if the stop loss is smaller i'm losing much more money and thus i'm able to completely remain focused and take more trades in the future also there's a better probability that the scalp will be reached because your target profit is lower and lower and even though i go for 8 tick target profit 8 to 10 ticks if i use limit orders it's still very mediocre or very minimal move in the market so i can easily reach the target profit and higher chance of
(19:56) catching a runner because the further back you place the rim in order the higher chance there is that you will not get stopped out on the noise but you will miss a lot of entries this was my personality the best i don't like using stop orders because i'm increasing my risk there can be even a slippage on a stop order if there is enough momentum in the market you can have one or two tick slippage even though it happens extremely extremely rarely in the yes so i'm gonna see you guys the next one take care buddy




(270) 3 SIMPLE Price Action Patterns That Will CHANGE Your Trading - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObLZtYJ_sAg

Transcript:
(00:00) welcome back to my youtube channel hopefully you're doing great in this video we'll go over three price action setups that you need to prioritize while reading a price action because during our trading sessions we as traders we constantly need to make quick snap decisions we are constantly re-analyzing the chart to make sure we are reading the market context correctly and for that reason we only want to prioritize and we only want to look for setups that has the highest likelihood of succeeding and this is what we're going to talk
(00:28) about in this video and basically what it all comes down to it is much more simple than general public would like you to believe if you want to be a consistently profitable trader you don't need any fancy indicators and you don't need any complicated strategies all you need to do is focus on these three setups number one is going to be a second entry to like a pullback with the trend at the proper key entry point key entry point is either trend line support or resistance line or the exponential moving average so you want to focus on the second entry
(01:00) with the direction of a trade trend you also want to focus on a felt second entries that goes against the trend during an uptrend second entry long is a good high probability setup and a second entry short is most likely going to trap traders who are trying to pick a major trend reversal so therefore second entry short failure within an uptrend is going to be a high probability setup and lastly most breakouts of consolidating areas of trading ranges will fail and therefore any breakout you want to fade you know
(01:35) most breakouts fails you want to be on the other side of the breakout now of course if you take these three setups blindly uh your win percentage is going to be still decent but not as high as you would like and this is where the skill of reading the price action comes into play and this is where you want to properly analyze the context so we're going to talk about how to analyze the context and how to look for these setups today's structure started with the looking for like a trading range with the bullish bias why this is
(02:02) a bullish bias because we keep making higher highs higher lows and we are slowly trending higher so you guys see that i have the short term trend lines on the chart and i have this for one specific reason when i have a breakover trend line traders will most likely create a new extreme this is the break and this is the new extreme indicating that the downtrend played out i have an uptrend i have a break i have a new high form indicating that the uptrend played out all right and i'm doing the same thing all over the place
(02:29) i'm drawing the shortened trend line and here we have our first high probability setup we have a new low and we have first entry short pullback second entry short and also we have a new high right here per century long pullback a second entry long since the uptrend played out so the most recent trend right now is buried downtrend and we have a break and we wait for a new extreme of the very downtrend so this is the two-legged pullback that i depicted right here with the proper context there's the break there's the new extreme which indicates
(03:00) that the downtrend played out downtrend can continue working lower all right it can happen but the way we would find it out would be if there would be a strong rejection of the ema but it didn't happen ema didn't put any resistance and we instantly reversed and pushed through it this is indicating that this dungeon truly played out and we are looking for reasons to go along this was the lowest low that we formed after this downtrend played out and we are starting our count over and we have a percentage short push higher above emi
(03:32) second entry short alright and if you take a look at this this picture right here this is the felt second entry short that goes against the trend because the downtrend played out and the uptrend is right now the most recent trend so this is the second entry short is the two like a pullback which would be a high probability setup but it goes against the trend and we are pushing above the ema so this would be a high probability setup all right now this second entry short failure is quite far away from ema so this is not particularly the setup
(04:01) that i would like but this lesson is mostly going to be about understanding the three main patterns that you want to look for as the price keeps pushing higher notice how i keep drawing the shortened trend lines i have a break i have a new extreme and you keep pushing higher quite strongly so there is a possibility that there can be a higher and larger pattern in play something like this which gives even more strength to the overall bullish bias so i have a break of a trendline i have a new extreme and you guys can see that
(04:30) i've wrote here a depletion when you see a big parse at the very end of the move at the very end of the trend a lot of times that indicates the depletion or exhaustion for the trend and the larger correction is most likely going to follow so you guys can see you have a break new extreme and also this is the failed breakout above this key level right i didn't mark this setup why because the overall bullish bias was so strong that you don't want to be risking fading the breakout even though if you combine it with the depletion this can
(05:02) be a much safer entry all right i keep drawing the trend lines even if it's with the direction of a trend you know there's a bigger uptrend and i need to draw my shortened trend lines even for the corrections and you guys can see every new high percentage long pullback second entry long but this is a horrible signal bar you cannot go long above bearish bar and there is no trigger above this polish bar plus you're inside of this channel so there is no second entry line right here but you guys see if you took this
(05:30) blindly without the proper contacts and without the proper signal bar you would got burned here all right take a look how this key level is forming at at that point on you're possibly expecting for price to go all the way down here but it didn't happen price pushed higher above ema gave you a higher low setup and they're indicating strong push above ema once more and these are felt second entry short this is the setup that we talked about earlier two felt attempts to go short against the trend overall trend is up this is the new low per
(06:00) essential short second entry short failure off the key entry point this is extremely important this bar is nicely hugging the ema and you have room to this prior swing so this is a high probability setup notice how you don't worry about taking all these setups up here all these setups down here those are not high probability you only focus on the best setups that you can when it comes to high probability setups they generally take time to develop and they're most likely not going to be a high probability setup right after high
(06:30) probability setup and you guys can see after this felt second entry short we didn't go much higher we created sort of like a double top and easily reversed we have a second entry long right here above the above the bearish bar which is not a great bar to have but i only marked it just for you guys to see that you need to combine the proper market context with the proper price action setup so this would be a two like a pullback that would have failed but you don't want to go long about this bar and you don't want to go long especially after you
(06:58) didn't really push that much higher because you'd be expecting for price to push all the way down here and not for price to create close like a double top and little correction all right at this point on you have bunch of bars going sideways and this is now the felt breakout this is the price action pattern the most breakouts will fail you guys can see a lot of bars going sideways you broke through the downside you with the direction of a trend so you're buying with the trend is the failed breakout and also on a slightly larger scale
(07:28) this is the two-legged pullback these are the two major lags right so this is the failed breakout and two major lags off the exponential moving average it worked barely enough for scalp and price action reversed and made the push higher and notice there is no high probability setup that i'm marking you have a new extreme your first century long pull back second entry long but you're not at the key entry point so you're not taking a trade remember maybe i haven't pointed it out you only want to focus on these setups
(07:55) at the proper key entry points at the trend lines at the support resistance lines or at the exponential moving average all right this is why you cannot go along here because there is no key entry point plus the shortened downtrend is in play you need to wait for the corrections to play out all right the market broke this trend line and created a first century short second entry short this is the two-legged pullback high probably set up off the ema i think it was a little bit too early still to pull the trigger here because
(08:23) you may be expecting for price to create a new high for the overall uptrend so i haven't marked this trade right here but this is the for you guys to see that this is the two legged pullback there is the new low and there's the first century short pull back a second entry short i was a little bit afraid to go short directly into this key level so this is why i skipped this trade but you guys can see how reliable these patterns are second entry short at ema second entry show you haven't quite touched the ema so this is why i don't like it also you
(08:47) have a break and a new low of the shortened downtrend and you are at the key level so you don't know what may happen mark market push lower as the market is pushing over and it keeps pushing over this normally indicates there is a larger pattern in play and this was the pattern that i was looking for at the time market created new extreme you have a first century short which is not yet the high probably the setup you have a second entry show you have the two like a pullback once again all right you have this second entry but
(09:16) this time it is with the downtrend so this is the only thing you're focusing you're not focusing a bunch of first entries you're not chasing the market going selling all the way at these lows this is how you're going to get trapped trying to risk a lot once you're getting far away from this key entry and wait for price come to the key entry point and wait for price to create the two like a pullback also this is the first break so you're expecting for market to create a new extreme all right so you have three good second entry shorts but
(09:42) this one is with the proper market contacts and it's at the proper key entry point hopefully that makes sense the market keeps pushing lower keys pushing lower you're not interested in any of these setups far from ema and you're definitely not picking a bottom take a look what would have been happening to you if you were trying to pick bottom every single time this is a falling knife stick with the trend even though you have a break and a new extreme you still want to see a reversal pattern before you go long all right but
(10:06) this is such a strong downtrend that you don't even want to look for a reversal pattern mark a push lower you have a new extreme you have a first century short little pullback second entry short this is the tool i get pullback once again with the direction of a trend and as we turn down at this point on i realized that there could be a higher pattern because take a look how many new lows you're making from this break new low new extreme new extreme new extreme constantly you're making your extreme so this is where i'm going to
(10:34) make my pattern slightly wider all right so the green pattern is right now valid because the first two swings confirmed it first two swings set the trendline up third swing confirmed it and i'm not taking this first entry and i have a second entry short lower high confirming the key entry point not just one not just one but two and i am able to sell of two key entry points ema and this trend line and look what would have happened quick easy scalp four high probability setups in a row all right take a look where you find yourself you
(11:05) find yourself at another major key level this was the high higher key level is the lower key level and like just like we talked about most breakouts train ranges will fail and this is on the bigger picture a large trading range with a big downtrend right and this is why i'm not marking the field breakout but it works like a clockwork you broke the ski level and you the breakout failed but i i'm not marking the longs here why because the downtrend is so big and the trading range is so large that let me just quickly measure this is 60
(11:40) and a half point downtrend in trading ranges once the trading range is big enough that there are trends legit trends within the trading range you need to stop fading the breakouts fading the breakout mainly goes in small to medium ones once the trading engine is large skip fading the breakouts because this is a 60 point downtrend and you never know how many few pushes you're going to make down and this is exactly what would have happened but you don't want to go short take a look at the new low first century short pull back second entry
(12:06) short you would go short directly below the key level when you're expecting for breakout to fail this is why the context is everything you cannot just close your eyes throw darts at the board and take every second entry you see you will make much more money if you combine with the proper market context all right plus you already move way too low and this is where your common sense is telling you i need to start selling because i've seen this market go down like this but you need to realize that in trading you want to wait for people to take
(12:35) profit and the deeper the correction the better you want to sell at the highs you cannot afford to sell at the lows all right i notice how once again i keep drawing my shortened trend lines i didn't enjoy it right here but i have a break attempt to create a new stream a break in your extreme here i have a trend line i have a break new extreme and there's a new low first century short a second entry short but this time it's above the ema all right we were supposed to push below ema and take a look there's the shortened option i can't go
(13:03) short just yet all right i'm definitely not thinking about buying because this is the 60 point move downtrend all right so there is a break attempt to create a new extreme and a big bearish bar with the lower high a lower high situation that close below ema off the key entry point and plus it's the first break of this entire downtrend you're expecting for price to create a new extreme and this is exactly what happened new extreme was formed and once you see a new extreme that's when you want to stop selling just yet this is why you have a new low
(13:34) first century short second entry short i'm not marking this because it pushed above the ema you're inside of this uptrend and you just formed a new extreme so there's going to be a correction at hand you cannot go short just yet you you have a rules you don't cherry pick you have a break new extreme so you're waiting for price to correct itself especially after such a strong downtrend this area was very confusing because you have a major downturn working lower and at the same time you're hovering around this key entry around this key level you
(14:04) guys can see that the ema is getting flat and i didn't mark any setup at this point because price is looking fairly bullish it's looking fairly bearish it's looking fairly bullish and finally market showed you the direction where it's one where you want to go and once the ema's flat like this you're starting to chop around it is better to avoid it any setups right here you have a new high first century long second entry long failure which probably tells you that this bigger downtrend is going to play out but i still think that
(14:33) this is quite hard to recognize in real time because there is this big consolidation area once market from this high and indicated you they were pushing back slowly below ema this is where you start looking for your larger pattern because right now we haven't just moved 60 points right now we have moved 16 almost 70 points and we keep pushing lower this was the fail breakout and from the failed breakout you're expecting for price to make it to the other side of the training range or at least to the middle and it didn't happen
(15:04) you just barely chopped around above this key level and you instantly pull back down this is a good indication that the downtrend is resuming strong push below ema you have a new extreme so remember what i'm looking at i'm looking for second entry with the trend trend is now down so i have a new new low first century short pullback second entry short this is once again the two-legged pullback at the ema at the key entry point so you have the contacts in play you have the key entry point you have the two like a
(15:34) pullback and you have a nice signal bar on this inside bar plus the uptrend played out with the little break new extreme form so you know that the buyers are no longer in control and the overall bias is bearish all right take a look whatever nice trade this would have been you have a new low and once again you're not worried about entering all the way down here you cannot react on fear of missing out that you missed some of these high probability setups and you're going to chase the market all the way down at
(16:03) these lows it worked on a day like this because the don show was so strong but it may not work and you're risking um you're risking without reason skip taking these trades all the way down here you have a new low first century short second entry short once again can you guess why it is not marked because it is not at the ema all right you already move way too down even though the bias is so strong bearish you're taking a chance you wait for price to get to key and triple you have a new low first century short second
(16:29) entry short off to exponential moving average you're basically shorting after this entire move played out so this is aggressive but since you have such a nice bar it was quick easy scalp off the exponential moving average i marked it anyway but looking back you're going short directly into the low of the day which is quite risky all right but once again you're focusing just on the three high probability setups now we could have been looking for let's say new high first century long second inch long failure remember second entry
(17:01) shorts with the downtrend are high probability setups and second entry longs are going to be traps so if the second inch long will fail that's a trap but i'm not marking any of these failed second entry longs new high first century long second entry loan failure because you already move way too down you're quite far away from ema this short right here so this is why i'm not marking this and i'm only focusing on the second entry with the trend all right you have a new extreme you have a percentage short pullback second entry short close
(17:30) below ema there is a little bit resistance starting to form you have a break attempt to create a new extreme but this was a strong dungeon and you have this resistance this is a trait worth a chance and you created a new swing low you were percentage short second entry short with the direction of a trend you have no key entry point so you're thinking shall i take this probably not but you draw the resistance and you understand that we've been going sideways how do i know i have multiple bottoms multiple tops and ema is flat
(18:00) and most breakouts of trading ranges will fail so this is going to be a high probability setup so you combine a second entry short with the failed breakout with the overall direction which is down or look at the massive downtrend now you're not thinking about buying at all even though you keep making multiple bottoms quadruple bottoms i don't care when the when you make 100 point move downtrend down you're not thinking about quickly buying all right so the price once again created a triple bot and you have a first century short pullback
(18:32) second entry short you have this short term uptrend that played out with the break new extreme you closed above the ema so this is a little bit disturbing you really want for price to close below but how take a look how this strong key entry point is holding multiple but multiple tabs you're once again shorting with the direction of a trend you can treat it as a failed breakout i try to enter on this bar right here once it showed you that you're really not going higher but it took off so quickly this one is slightly
(19:02) slightly aggressive since you close above the ema and you're very close to key entry points you might expect price to push here but since this is a trading range and most breakouts fail you're at the highs after and played out second entry short this is the two legged pullback this is how you wanna trade right and once again market push lower and you're broke below this trading range most breakouts fail but you're not buying why because the overall bias is down don't pick a bottom once again you have a first century short second entry
(19:30) short you're not taking this you're far from key entry point you're shorting at the very low of the day okay you always have to wait for price come to you to your key entry point you have a new low first century short second entry short but you closed above the ema and you have no key entry point you have no trading range no resistance no fail break higher you have you're not below ema and you're not you're not at the trend line so this is in a no man's land and you see you would have got easy trap but still trading is about taking a chance no
(19:59) strategy is perfect so if you take every single second entry you're still going to have seven seventy percent mid percentage blindly all right this goes to show you how just you need to focus on the second entries you have a break of the straight line new extreme form so that means that we're expecting correction or straight up reversal if a strong move higher uh at this point this is starting to be quite confusing a lot of the times because according to price action rules after breaking new extreme you're expecting correctional state of reversal
(20:28) but when you have such a strong downtrend strong trend you know that you're most likely going to be making new extremes and new extremes constantly so i don't recommend looking for longs unless you have really a proven uptrend working in that bullish direction because the overall bigger patterns always takes precedence and when you move 100 points down that's the bigger pattern so i haven't marked any long here i haven't marked even any short here because it's not really clear what's going to happen here you have a
(20:57) break you have first lecture in your extreme pull back second like the new stream so you know that the option played out you have a push lower below ema indicating strong bearish momentum and once again you're not one you're not even thinking about a bunch of these setups you actually have a new high first century long second entry long failure but it is a horrible doji bar and take a look you push strong ability ema and we look what you have new low percentage short second intro to like a pullback on a bigger picture
(21:25) you have a break and a new extreme of the uptrend that indicates that it played out and you're at the key entry point you have a nice signal bar this is the second entry short once again you you push lower look what you have here first century short i don't care even if it's a key entry point i don't care i have a new law i have another new low so i'm no longer thinking about selling and market keeps rolling up higher but i already started doing this lesson and it is getting quite late and we have once again the volatility still remains
(21:55) but hopefully you guys understand that these three setups making me that make it a little bit visible these three setups are your breadth and body that you focus on but you need to read the proper market context draw your trend lines stick with the trend and know you're not going to be perfect especially when you're learning you're going to make a lot of mistakes but with time it will get much much easier and you will realize that you're mainly main your mistakes are coming mainly from your from your mind because you're probably
(22:30) forcing trades you're taking in trades that are risky that you shouldn't be taking you're not waiting for signal bars to finish you're trying to pick bottoms or trying to pick tops you're you're tweaking the rules just a little bit and your mind is playing tricks with you and you are not really you know trained yet to um to to contain your mind so remember the psychological aspect of trading is even more important than this you can learn this within two or three years you can find these setups easily and have 70 win
(23:00) percentage almost anybody can do that but to remain patient and not jump the gun not be afraid of taking trades because not taking a trade is a trading error as well when you see a nice second entry at the key entry point with the trend you need to pull the trigger because if you don't that means that the next setup you will take if it's losing trade you don't have your numbers all right because you're supposed to be taking the hyper high probability trades and if you're skipping them that your math is not on
(23:29) point all right so the more setups high probability you take to overall in the long run your numbers are going to be better all right so hopefully this video was helpful hopefully you guys uh find it useful keep keep looking for these setups let me quickly make it a break new extreme you have a break new stream first century long second entry long big push lower you have a new low first let me just finish it quickly since i'm already doing this you you have a new low first entry shot so you're not interested you have a new
(24:04) low first century short second entry short where at the key entry point price cannot let price ema cannot let price close above it and then you have a clear new extreme and two lakhs so i wouldn't take this second entry show you have a second intro right here first century short second entry short but ema is holding you guys can see how reliable it's like a pullback pattern is but you since you already have a break in a new extreme i think it's getting quite risky to keep forcing trade so i'm not going i'm not the fan of this trade
(24:35) all right so i'm gonna wrap it up enjoy the weekend take care bye






(270) Does PRICE ACTION Work In All Markets And Timeframes? - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWjUp_Df_t0

Transcript:
(00:00) if i learn to read the price action if i learn to use this price action strategy am i going to be able to use it in different markets as well on this channel i teach you guys how to find high probability setups what is a high probability setup well high probability setup is as simple as a two-legged pullback second entry at the key entry point it comes down to human psychology if humans attempt to do something once they won't give up they will try to do it again it is simple it's not complicated but it works if you enter on
(00:31) a second entry with the direction of a trend at the proper key entry point key entry point is a place where confluence appears and the setup is strong that will generate a high probability setup but does this strategy work in all structures time frames and markets or can you learn and apply this skill on any market you want and this is what we're going to talk about in this video so we're looking at the nq nasdaq one minute time frame and as straight as we know that we're looking for second entries with the direction of a trend
(01:02) and we're looking for key entry points so as the ema is pointing down i see a downtrend so only thing i have in mind is a high priority setup is going to be two-legged pullback to key entry point and price is working lower this is the first lag pull back second leg two leg a pull back to the exponential moving average and this set up the trend line high priority setup there's the first entry long pullback second entry long but the trend is down so any second entry to buy is most likely going to fail and thus create a
(01:30) high probability setup downtrend still continues i'm resetting the count first entry short second entry short looking for high priority setups with the direction of a trend second entry short not touching the ema not at the key entry point still inside of this channel followed by a break new extreme indicating that the upgram played out and there's a double trap entry at the exponential moving average high probability setup trendline got confirmed ema is holding price lower high confluence of two key entry points
(01:59) in a downtrend market reverse uptrend followed by a break new extreme which indicates that the uptrend played out first century long pullback second entry long failure we're not looking to go long because option played out high probability setup failure lower high coming off double top and a failed second entry long again because the bearish momentum is strong indicated by push below the exponential moving average market continues pushing lower resetting the count here only thing that i'm looking for is a high
(02:29) probability setup two leg a pullback is that simple first century short second entry short but far away from ema i cannot take this new low right here first century short pull back second entry short confluence of two key entry points trend line and the exponential moving average generates a high probability setup new high first century long pullback second entry long failure this is the nasdaq one minute time frame and price action still remains completely perfect it depicts human behavior and what about crypto can i use
(03:00) it on bitcoin as well let's take a look this is a bitcoin and daily time frame the uptrend started after this move right here so i'm already going to use the geometrical structure to help me find the trend line and i can also find it off the high so i'm just going to copy it put it at the bottom i see a uptrend some only thing i'm looking for is a high probability setup which will be to like a pullback at the key entry point i have a new high first century long pullback second entry long horrible signal bar pass i'm waiting new low
(03:30) high low confirmed two-legged pullback key entry point exponential moving average is holding giving me a good indication that this is going to generate a bullish move market push higher new high resetting the count first century long second entry long far away from exponential moving average i'm not touching the exponential moving average i'm not interested market pushed lower created a horrible doji bar below ema not interested and gave you a nice bullish bar coming off the key entry point and you closed above the
(03:59) exponential moving average confluence of two key entry points market push higher new high first century long pullback second entry long big bullish bar ema holds price i'm still expecting a second like the new extreme price action works like clockwork uptrend played out so i'm expecting correction or straight up reversal drawing these trend lines i have an uptrend i have a break attempt to create new extreme micro double top holds price big bearish bar i have a new low first century short second entry short above
(04:31) this multiple tops resistance failed breakout nice british bar high probably the setup two like a pullback up we still need a new extreme to be formed and market formed a new extreme following the trendline rules i have a new low first century short second entry short a little bit risky because we just had a new extreme but if you wait new high first century long pull back second entry long indicated by the ema rejecting the price that you want to bet that the price will sell off from this point on the market reverse lower market
(05:03) reverse higher new low first century short pullback second entry short failure second entry short is going to fail because the downtrend played out indicated by break and in new extreme form strong push above ema is indicating the bullish momentum and i have a nice reversal pattern exponential moving average is holding as the price is working an uptrend i'm looking for second entry long with the direction of a trend new high first century long pullback second entry long at the two key entry points new extreme resetting the count
(05:36) looking for the same simple setups first century long pullback second entry long there's actually a little second entry long right here your stop loss goes one tick below the signal bar so you're still safe confluence of two key entry points a big bullish bar and then you have a high low setup break of a spike in a channel expecting new extreme perfect price action you're expecting correction or straight up reversal market continues in uptrend first century long pull back second inch long two like a pullback where
(06:05) key entry point exponential moving average new low first century short second entry short failure uptrend is now in effect so any second entry is going to fail and any second entry is most likely going to work that's the basis of strategy and market is reversing lower we're looking at apple weekly time frame uptrend is in effect spike and channel pattern only thing that is going to be interesting is a high probability setup at the key entry point i'm using the exponential moving average as a key entry point i'm using the trend line
(06:39) as a key entry point and i'm looking for two like a pullback new extreme is form so i'm resetting the count first century long second inch long exponential moving average keeps holding indicating me that the key entry point is holding new levels form right here first century short second entry short failure any attempt to sell is most likely going to fail any second entry because this is an uptrend new four resetting the count first century long pullback second entry long horrible signal bar high low has a nice bullish bar
(07:09) confirmed this key entry point nice polish momentum and i have a new high first century long back second inch long of confluence of two key entry points in a bullish structure i'm not overthinking this to like a pullback at the key entry point is a high probability setup new high only a first entry more aggressive one but since two key entry points are holding in a strictly bullish structure i can take this entry now am i using this strategy for long-term investments to be honest with you i'm not i'm just dollar cost averaging every single month
(07:45) i don't even think about it just the way i pay my taxes every single month i just put a very small portion of my money into the long term investments and i let it run for 20 years i don't even touch it but you know you can use this even on weekly time frames guys i just showed you that the price action is simple it represents a human behavior and it works in all time frames and in all markets you want to spend your time studying the one time frame in one market and mastering it because every time frame and every market has a different
(08:13) tendencies and you wouldn't become a master of one single market don't over complicate it you guys can see that the easy price action second entry to like a pullback is a high priority setup ema is holding price nicely key entry points are holding knife pricely you're looking for confluences and if you learn to master price action you have a skill that will be worthwhile long in the future so take care everybody

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on guys welcome back to my youtube channel and in this video we're going to talk about the price action rules in general and our rules how we actually take the trades but before we get started we need to take a little moment and talk about how market actually moves and how the prices on the prices print on the chart the first the most important thing to realize is that we cannot move the market we are average retail traders it doesn't matter how many contracts you can trade unless you're
(00:29) ridiculously wealthy if you and your 20 friends sit down in one room and try to take a trade and you think you're gonna make the market move it's not just gonna happen just not gonna happen so we need to understand that there are big players dynamic players they are moving the market and these players are big institutions hedge funds banks all these all these institutions are using mostly programs and softwares to do the trading for them so all we are doing we're just following these big players we're just following the dynamic traders who can move the
(01:04) market we cannot move the market so all the price action trading is and all we are doing here is we're just it's just we're like we are tracking wild game we're just tracking the wild animal that is leaving footprints leaving mess where had it has been you know leaving some sort of scent you're passing through all this is what we are trying to accomplish here because nobody knows where the market is going to be week from now nobody knows but those people who are actually taking the trade those people who got deep enough pockets
(01:35) those big players they know where the market is going to be because they are they're the ones who are moving the market they are the ones who are moving the market so they know what's going to happen 90 of retail traders on youtube nobody knows what's gonna happen even i don't know what's gonna happen long term i just know that if i follow the price action and i will follow their footprints i will get my skull portion and i get out and that's what i'm trying to show you guys here okay so now that we understand how market moves we where do we find the proper entries
(02:07) because we cannot just take any entry we see we can't just enter on every single bar thinking that we're going to work we just need to we need to have some reason for entering we need to find the proper spots when the prices are reversing when the prices are pulling back then the prices are making corrections we need to find the proper entry to know how to correctly follow these big players and this is basically what we are trying to do here there is a lot more to price action trading but our key setup our key thing that we are looking for is the second entry at the very
(02:41) important entry point or or key entry point and what are key entry points key entry point is trendline ema or support and resistance these are the key entry points these three or four if you count support and resistance s2 these four for lines or for support and resistance type levels are the key entry points of where we are looking to find the second entry and why we find why we are looking for second entry and not just first entry or not third third entry well because you can actually check the al brooks's material on this because i have studied al brooks almost religiously when i started
(03:22) trading it is hard to understand but it works he explains that when people are trying to do something once they will usually give it one more try before they stop doing it again so when it works the same way in trading if traders are trying to move the market up they will try to do it once if it fails they will take a little break and try to do it again then if it fails again there is 90 chance that they will completely abandon their decision and go with the flow so this is why we are looking for second entries and but not just second entries anywhere on the chart like i said
(04:00) at the key entry point but simultaneously we are also looking at failed second entries and your first thought is probably well what's the difference you know how do i know when the second entry is failing so i know that it is a failed second entry and not just second entry that is failing on me well the the difference is we are trying to take second entry with the trend and when we are trading we are taking failed second entries it's usually counter trend trade like for example this is a felt second entry long
(04:34) and this is a second entry short it is a failed second entry long because we are in a downtrend and it is a valid second entry short because we are once again in a downtrend so these are the main setup that we are looking for but before i get into more details about the price action rule in general how the market actually moves because there are the rules of the trend line and rules of the trading ranges i'm gonna take a quick moment to actually describe a little bit the money management and how you actually
(05:05) handle placing an order into the market when it comes to money management system this is basically up to the trader himself i recommend going at least for one to one ratio meaning you risk you're gaining the same amount as you're potentially risking in the esd i'm trading right now i'm going for 10 ticks and most of the stop loss i take are around the two point area so this is why i hedge my bets that i'm going only for one to one ratio but if you're trading stocks or forex it's not going to be 10 ticks per se because this is typical for es but you can eyeball it how much is the
(05:45) average stop loss you basically have to sim trade it long enough to get the feel what the average stop loss is and you're gonna your target profit is going to be the similar amount as the stop loss you are averaging on let's say 100 trades and this should be equal to your skull portion whether to place a stop stop order or limit or this is solely up to you i like limit orders because i like to sneak a little bit back to you know hedge my bet so i can scalp much more easily but if you like stop orders hey
(06:18) it's your choice it doesn't really matter i just me personally i like limitors the only thing that is absolutely rigid is you have to put your stop one tick below this below or above the signal bar so if you look at this area right here this big bearish signal bar you have to put your stop loss one tick above the signal bar you don't want to put it more ticks than one take because if if the prices go one take about this very signal bar the prices are most likely going in the opposite direction and you're most likely wrong so you just want to catch your losses catch your losses as
(06:57) quickly as you can you don't want to be one of those guys who keep moving the stop further and further back and giving all the money back on one single trade trust me we've all been there so put your stop loss one tick above or below the signal bar that you're taking the trade this is a rigid and you cannot you cannot change this rule and the final rule when it comes to other actually two more rules when it comes to managing the trade if you miss a trade and you actually get the scout portion let's say you go short here and market moves and scalps the 10 ticks but you didn't get
(07:35) filled but your order is still hanging here you have to cancel it because the trade has worked but you didn't get filled you get left behind and that's okay but you cannot wait to get filled again and then hoping you're gonna make the trade happen once again it's not once a trade makes the scalp portion and you didn't get filled you have to cancel the order and look for the next one and final rule when it comes to managing the trade is you have to let the signal bar finish this is the big problem when i first started trading you
(08:09) know a bunch of years back ago is i actually stumbled upon a few traders who taught me to try to sneak a little bit early when you see the signal bar pushing in one direction place the stop place the stop order there and hope the signal bar is going to work but you you you don't want to jump the gun you need to wait for prices to finish for signal bar to finish to know whether it is truly a bearish bar or a bullish bar if you're looking to go long so never try to sneak in early you know the price just because prices
(08:39) are reversing nicely on one move doesn't mean that they're not gonna bounce back few few last ticks in a few last seconds they might go in a completely opposite direction you just got trapped because you went long or short too early so always wait for prices to complete their the the closer countdown and i just want to quickly talk about two price action rules that are common for the markets and the main rule is called the trend line rule and the rule says that after a break of a trend line there is most likely going to be
(09:15) a re-test of a new extreme after break of a trend line you are expecting at least correction and ninety percent wise a break and a new extreme up you can see they happen right here break new extreme you can see they happen right here break and a new extreme and it happened it's happening on smaller trend lines as well so this is the rule of the trend line and there's a rules rule of trading ranges stick with me i know there is a lot to talk about but it is worth it because i explain this in the video as i go on so i want you guys to understand what i'm talking about what i'm looking for
(09:49) once the prices go into trading range the trending range the best way to trade trading range is obviously sell the highs and buy the lows duh that's what everybody's teaching you probably know that that you should avoid trading in the middle but the best way to trade trading ranges is the faith the breakouts fading is trading in opposite direction of the breakout this is the fading of the breakout and this would be the fading of the breakout and you can see most breakouts of trading ranges will fail but let's talk about
(10:19) actually the practice of the rules as you can see prices are working lower so we are in a downtrend now and what are we doing we are waiting for second entries at the key entry point so this is the new low prices are working higher but we did not triggered below any of these bars we didn't trigger below any of these bars this was the first bearish bar that we triggered below this you can see we triggered below this bar this is the first entry it is close to the key entry point so we can count that this depends on experience
(10:51) but this is just the first entry this is not according to a rule so we have to skip this trade just because it worked here doesn't mean it's going to work next time but price prices tried to make one more push higher and failed once again now this is still part of first entry but now we made a lower high it is still at the key entry point and trendline rules are telling us that we are looking for a new extreme so this is why it is a good trait to take even though it is not a textbook second entry just because it's not second entry doesn't mean that if you got more rules there you
(11:25) know connecting the dots for you you're not going to take the trade but if you're just starting out looking for typical second entries is the best way i'm marking all the possible setups because i got the experience and i want you guys to get the tips what i've learned so right now we are working lower we made a break and a new low a little bit push lower so this trend line has already played out the downtrend has already played out and now what we are looking for the trendline rules are telling us we should be looking
(11:55) for a correction at least or a complete reversal and this is what happened prices reversed from here and once again notice this we are not breaking lower below any of these bars this is the first break lower so this is just first entry below this bar prices are pulling higher so first entry failed first entry short fell what when we broke about this bar this is a failure so prices tend to mate attempted to make a second entry we are working higher we triggered one tick below this bar we're pulling back first entry felt second entry triggered
(12:30) below this bar this would be good bar to take good trade to take this would be a good second entry because we worked higher we spiked through ema ema is holding so this is one key entry point there is a trend line this is the second can second key entry point so we got two key entry points going in our direction we are looking for new high and we are looking for a reversal because this downtrend has played out with the break and a new low the only reason why i didn't mark this trade even though it is a perfect setup is because the signal bar is absolutely horrible we are looking to go
(13:05) long and we need a nice bullish reversal bar like this this is a bearish bar stims on both sides so even though this is a second entry the signal bar is important don't forget that and one and we made a one push lower still at the key entry point still at the trend line and at the ema so this is why this was a good trade beautiful signal bar so just something to think about second entry was perfect key entry points were perfect and you see if you would have taken it it would have worked you know because the second entry is such a powerful setup it still would have worked we just want to maximize
(13:40) we want to get as much higher probability on our side as we can so it's better to wait for the better signal bar and once again we are working higher we have a break couple legs to a new extreme and you can see we broke few ticks higher so we have a new high here so what the rules of the trend line are telling us after a break over of the trend line we're most likely going to have a correction and a break and a new extreme and this is what happened here so we have a double tap forming here you're expecting the reversal as it is happening you can see we pull back
(14:13) through ema this is the new low this is the new this low is lower than this low so the count stands over from here pull back first entry be triggered you can see the one you can see the one little tick break below this bearish bar so this is just a first entry but it's not according to our rules we are looking for second entry so pull back first entry pull back second entry the first entry felt once we triggered one tick above this bearish bar so this is a failure first entry failed and the second entry triggered with the take one tick lower below this
(14:51) doji bar it is at the ema we are looking for break and a new low of this trend line so second entry at the key entry point at the ema and we are waiting for a new low good quick scalp to take i was quite the surprise i was surprised that uh we reversed once again highly laggier and this you can see nothing in price action is 100 and nothing is going to work 100 nothing is written in stone but you can see you can get even if we are we were off here but our rule still got us easily our skull portion this is what we're trying to do this is the nice advantage of intraday trading we
(15:28) can actually we can even be wrong and still make a winning trade because this is how this strategy is set up to do you don't have to be right on big moves you just have to follow the institutions and just get the piece of their money just get the piece of their money and it turned out we actually made a few more legs the new high this was the first lag this was the second lag you can see it's not quite measured but it this was very surprising move i don't know what happened here nobody knows only the institutions who are placing the trades no but we definitely got a new high here
(16:06) this trend line working hard higher you have a new high here but you can make a case that a lot of traders probably didn't take this new high into consideration so they tried to make a new high but that's up for debate but you can see clearly new high here this bullish trend is over now just like this bearish trend was over here here this bullish trend is over so now this is the highest high of this entire swing this height is higher than this wing is higher than this wing this is the highest high of this move
(16:36) so we're counting over from now prices are pulling lower first entry triggered one tick above this bullish bar we're working lower we're shooting through the ema and second entry triggered one tick above this bearish bar so we now we now have two like a pullback first entry second entry and now we can draw the trend line you can see trend line is fitting nicely from the both sides this is how you know you have the trend line correct if the prices are fitting neatly in the trend line so the second entry is now open because people who went long on the second entry went along one tick above this
(17:13) bearish bar it is a horrible signal bar ignore that for our counting rules this is the second entry and with the break and you can see this bar this bar broke this bar made the second entry long as a failure but we like i said we need to wait for signal bar to finish we cannot you cannot enter let me put let me show you this so you can see a little bit more clearly we cannot enter one take below this bullish bar you can't then one tick like this below this this bullish bar because this we need to wait for proper signal bar this is a
(17:55) horrible bullish signal bar so with this signal bar this made the second entry failure signal bar but we didn't take lower so the felt second entry long didn't trigger for us for us to go short it happened here we made one push higher the the trend line is still holding it's a key entry point and now we finally triggered below this and even this so this is a failed second entry long not that perfectly clear but it is there and you can see it worked once again and just like always you have a trend working lower and you have a break now you're at the ema so what do we do okay we draw the trend line because the
(18:39) shorter term trend lines will work as well this is just a first entry we've triggered one tick below this beautiful reversal bar but it's just the first entry we cannot take this and there are trades there are first entries that i'm going to mark because based on experience i'm getting the gut feeling that's going to work so if you watch my videos this is what i'm trying to show you but if you if you want to stick religiously to the second entries you have to skip this and it's a good move to skip this so we have a first entry here
(19:08) here prices pull back and the second entry here first entry pull back second entry with the trigger below this doji looking bar we are at the key entry point you can see how ema is not letting prices to close higher so this is one key entry point this is one key element of our rules it is a second entry second element of our rules we are in the midst of a correction in the break and we are looking for a new extreme third element of our rule because we are waiting for this for the new low of this downtrend
(19:44) working lower and you have a break and you have a trailer working higher break and attempt to make a new high now you are probably wondering why sometimes we get a clear new high and sometimes we just get attempt the attempt a lot of times is enough for us to count it as a new high you cannot make a new high here because we are at the key entry point and the key entry point will not will allow us to make the new high so we just have to set be happy and be content with at least attempt for prices to make a new high so this is the second entry
(20:21) once again you can see perfect price action this is textbook price action and it's actually good that i get to film this video under such a beautiful textbook day most days are not like this and once again for some reason we kept going lower here maybe there's a bigger pattern unfolding can be something like this this can be possibility um of course if you're a beginner trader with the break and a new low you should be stop looking for shorts okay this was really right but notice how this is a little bit more advanced this is why with experience you get better
(21:01) and better get this why this is a good second entry once again notice new low we are working higher first entry break make a new high this bullish correction is over we have a break and a new high second secondary trigger one take below this it is almost repeat pattern of this even more more perfect the key entry point is still holding but the reason why it's okay to look for shorts here because you can see how the ema is rejecting prices this is not a reversal pattern you can see take a look at this you have a break right here you have a
(21:40) trend line working lower break new low and you can see how prices push the ema and ema now acts as a support this is a reversal pattern we push through the ema and ema acts like a support so ema is helping us here to go long because it acts as a support but here this is not a reversal pattern this is the opposite of reversal pattern even though we are expecting at least a correction and this is what happened this was a correction we are expecting to make uh to reverse from here you need to wait for a reversal pattern just like reverse the pattern happened right here because we went through the ema
(22:16) and like here we went through ema you have a trend working higher break new high and you can see how ema didn't put any resistance we slice through it like it's not even there and now it's holding as a resistance this is a reversal pattern this is not a reversal pattern the ema we didn't close above ema how how how can this be a reversal pattern if we didn't even close above the ema ema is not holding as a support it's actually doing the opposite it's holding as a resistance so this is a tool like a pullback
(22:51) second entry once again textbook setup so i hope this is helpful to you and it is quite a lot to take in but you can see the second entries they are there it is fairly it is obviously it is not that clear cookie cutter once you're trading live but you can see if you follow the short term trend lines you follow the ema and you're waiting for second entries if you're just patient this is what happens a lot of people a lot of people are they're either being too scared to enter on the right second entry or they
(23:24) are being way too patient excuse me they are being they're jumping in the gun way too much they're jumping way too early but let's take a look actually yesterday and you can see how yesterday played that once again you are working lower you have a break and a new high and the reversal from here this is textbook price action you can see i'm not making this stuff up this this stuff works and you can actually learn this if you just dedicate yourself to it and this is a reversal pattern you can see how ema ema is not even there we slice through the email like nothing reversal pattern
(23:59) but let's talk this this is what i mentioned a few minutes ago how the shorter term trend lines sometimes we will not get a new extreme because the key entry point is holding the prices and this is once again the situation the key entry point here is the trend line and the ema here this is the new law of the move bear with me i know just grab your popcorn grab some juice or coffee and just let's get into this this is a new low pull back first entry we triggered one tick lower below the signal bar it failed on them we broke higher it
(24:37) felt on them and a second entry one tick lower below this single bar so this is the second entry and the signal bar is horrible but you can see it still once again it would have worked perfectly because the price action works why i don't like taking this straight apart from this being another great signal bar is because the trend line rule works as well on the smaller trend lines on the smaller you know the patterns and we have a small little correction working higher here we have a break an attempt to make a new high this is the first break and prices trigger one tick above this and you can
(25:15) see prices tried and tried to go higher they tried to retest this bullish trend line working her low higher but they got slapped on their hand and instantly reversed down because there's a key entry point there is a trendline working lower there is a ema and this is the lower high and this is similar pattern to here we are we are working higher first entry and you can see prices went a little bit lower and still they tried to make the new high they pushed higher but instantly the ema and the people are waiting this was such a strong move down people are waiting for a new low this is the lower high so the the key
(25:54) entry point in the overall momentum didn't allow this shorter term prices to make a new high and this is what happened the same thing happened here so we make work lower so you now have a break but now once again you have a trend line working higher you have a break and attempt to make a new high this is this is not that cookie cutter clean for beginners this is a good trade for a little bit experienced traders because we are still looking for shorts this is such a big move down gigantic move down so even though you have you don't have a new high and the key entry point is not
(26:35) allowing it it is still very good trade because this bullish trend line now have a break and at least attempt but this was such a strong move down that i actually took this trade and i liked it but you will actually learn this with experience so don't worry and if you're just unsure you just you can just skip this it's okay but remember price action rules worked once again break new low so we are now looking for for at least a correction or reversal but you can see i'm just i'm just gonna throw a little nugget in here this is once again almost 90 degree angle move and i keep telling
(27:13) you they won't last a long time so once you see trend line a break and a big sharp 90 degree angle move you're most likely going to reverse from here so this was very expected by experienced traders and once again take a look another situation and you can see the second entries are working but it's more safer you get much more higher probability win percentage you get 90 win percentage if you just wait for the retest of a new extreme the attempts just like we tried to make a new high here and the key entry point is holding
(27:46) the prices we have a new high here pullback first entry we trigger one tick higher above this bullish bar it failed working lower second entry we trigger one tick above this so this is a second entry long of the trend line and off to ema and a little bit even off the trend line it's not perfect but you don't have to be perfect so looking back now this i'm probably gonna even mark it because this is such a beautiful signal bar but you can see how much safer it is to wait prices broke higher so we have a break of the australian working lower and attempt to make a new extreme but the ema one
(28:22) key entry point trend line second key entry point the key entry points didn't let the prices make the new extreme and this is a beautiful bullish reversal bar you have to go along here and you're working higher and higher you make a new high here you have a first entry pullback second entry and you can see how horrible signal bar this is and if you just if you just create blindly second entries you would have gotten burned here but that's still that's okay because you have four four winners here or you have i don't know two energy or multiple
(28:54) winners here that's what trading is about nothing works 100 if you just close your eyes and take this horrible berry signal bar you got trapped because the signal bar was horrible you're looking for a signal bar like this because we're going long so we need nice bullish reversal signal bar but it's okay if you take all the second entries with the trend you're still gonna end up with 70 win percentage easily we're just trying i just like to be right as much as i can even though i want to be emotionless as
(29:24) a trader i just want to get my odds in my favor so you can see you have a break new ho new low new low right here the ema is holding and you're looking for a new extreme to make a new extreme and some of you might ask why i'm not looking for failed second entry with the canon trend trade you're looking for failed second entry once you once the one trend played out so you have a break now here of this bigger bullish uptrend you have a new high here so this from this point on if you want to count trend trade that's where you look for failed second entries with the trend we're looking for second entries and
(30:08) content right we're looking for failed second entries but now we're getting into trading range category and you can see that the trading range now we have to a little bit tweak our rules because now we have to play trading range rules and with during trading range we are most likely looking to buy the lows and sell the highs and fade the breakouts i'm just going to mark it you know i didn't take this trade and it is hard to take i'm just going to mark it as a failed breakout for purpose of this example and you can see you always have to draw these shortened
(30:45) trend lines and you can see nothing is perfect we didn't make a new low right here because there's a key entry point to support we we though have made a new high here we're working higher brake this is a key entry point look at this this is a key entry point support is proven good trade according to our training range rules we're working higher we made a two legs to a new high and now trading range support easy to find resistance easy to find okay we have a break of this bullish trend line of this bush train line break
(31:17) new high so we are looking from this point this is our chance to look for failed second entries this is the because this correction played out this bullish momentum played out we are at the resistance and we are now concentrating because we're we are about to sell the highs we're smart traders we're selling the highs you even have a little bit break break out here so this is a fail break higher as well this is the new high right here this high is a little bit higher than this high price is pulling back lower back in the trading range first entry we trigger one tick above this bullish bar
(31:52) we trigger one tick above this bullish bar it failed so first century long failed but once again human psychology people will attempt to do things twice this is a tool like a pullback market moves in tools remember this is it and look at this oops this is a tool like a pullback on a little bit smaller picture one leg second leg and it is a two legged pullback on a little bit bigger picture this is the one leg this is the one leg and this is the second leg so there's the levels to this and it may seem a little bit
(32:31) overwhelming now but once you get into this it will be fairly easy to identify the two like a pullbacks but this is the first entry second entry long it's going going higher and it it's failing it failed one tick below this big bearish bar now i marked this for sake of the example this is a failed second entry long at the high of the trading range nevertheless my experience is telling me that we are on the ema and you can see ema is kind of holding the prices so once we made this beautiful bullish reversal bar gigantic bar a lot of people jump on board going along into the resistance this is
(33:10) a little bit lower high this is still the continuation of the failed second and failed second entry long but this is much safer setup right here but nevertheless the second failed second entry long still would have worked easily so you can see that the rules apply when i'm doing my videos i'm just trying to give you all the nuggets that i've learned over the years almost over the decade i'm in my ninth year now i started trading when i was 18 or 19 something like that so i want to give you as much as knowledge as
(33:41) much experience as i possibly can and you have a fail break higher and fail break road this is pretty much self-explanatory that you want to once you're this is hard for beginners to trade because this is so counterintuitive because look at this bullish uptrend now and look how the prices has proven you know common thomas you you cannot go short here because the prices have proven anybody with a common sense any doctor any engineer any lawyer can see that the market is going higher who on their with their right mind will
(34:13) want to sell this market when it has proven prices have told us that we are going higher well this is the common sense that you have to throw out the window because of common sense some of the most smartest people and some of the wealthiest retirees the people that are very experienced and very successful in real life are failing miserably in trading because they rely on their common sense common sense will not help you in trading you have to erase completely every everything you've learned during your life and embrace the way market things and market operates
(34:48) because this is so hard to take this is so hard to take but you can see you have to trust the rules that the most breakouts will fail and it happened and it happened right here you can see look at this bearish momentum going over now we are clearly reversing okay i was wrong right here i was trying to go along here but it failed but now i'm gonna be right look how this bearish momentum is going over okay now we are reversing okay okay i gotta go i gotta go short i gotta go short i'm gonna go short on this bullet on this doji bar
(35:17) right at the low of the move and boom it's a fail break lower and smart institutions are going higher they just trapped everybody so this is just some something to think about hopefully this video was helpful to you um it is you can see the second entries with the trend they are there at the key entry points the ema it is a 21 bar ema by the way this is the key entry point and if you get any comments you know feel free to put in the comment section i will try to reply or you can shoot me an email i will though it will take me a little
(35:49) bit of time to get through all the emails because the channel is growing which i really appreciate and i got only a little amount a limited amount of time in day but hopefully you liked the video hopefully this was useful to you and i see you guys in the next video bye guys





(270) Price Action Trading For Beginners: How to Trade Reversals | Trading Tips - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MQeh50nW5s

Transcript:
(00:00) all right reversal trading can be very tricky and very hard and this is what i'm going to show you in this video how to successfully found a concentrate entries and how to find a reversal pattern because a lot of traders get you know they get trapped fairly quickly trying to predict a reversal and trying to recognize when the current trend is over and the new trend is starting out and there are three key factors or three key rules that we need to follow when we are trying to identify that the trend is reversing and we are looking for a
(00:30) reversal pattern because when we are reversal trading we just don't want to blindly pick tops or pick bottoms we actually want for market to prove us to tell us that the trend is reversing successfully and there is no more bears in this particular instance because we're talking about downtrend are left in the market so what we are going to be looking for is reversal pattern so the first rule and the first key factor that we are looking for is that we need to recognize that the current trend is over and that is trend line rules the
(01:05) second key factor is there has to be two failed attempts in the direction of the current trend and the third rule is we're going to be using the ema exponential moving average 21 bar it is 21 bar ema so if you're new to trading just set up the 21 bar ema this is going to be helping us give us additional information about the reversing pattern so let's start up the first rule is the trendline rule and trend ryan rule is telling us that after a break of a trendline there is most likely going to be a retest of a new low
(01:39) so you can see the trend line i've found right here you can see the downtrend we're making lower highs lower lows the ema is pointing down the trend line is fitting from the lows and from the highs so when the trend line is active we cannot be looking to buy we cannot be looking for country trend entries by any means we need to stick with the trend because the trend is your friend you know we've all heard this millions of times where we have a first break of this downtrend working lower but that doesn't mean we're going to
(02:08) go long here no the trend line rules is telling us that after a break there is most likely going to be a retest of a new extreme and this is what happened here so after break of a downtrend of this trend line working lower we have a new extreme we have a new low okay so now we can potentially be looking for at least correction or possibly a full-blown reversal but we just don't want to still keep buying because it is impossible to pick bottoms like this anything can happen it can easily take one thing higher and go back down and you know
(02:38) we would have gotten stopped out nobody can pretty much predict whether to go long here what we need to wait is for higher probability setup higher probability reversal pattern and here comes the second rule two felt attempts in the direction of a trend so when this new low exists what we are looking for is second entry short that is going to fail this is a new low pullback working up higher first century short this is the first entry by the bears trying to push the market lower and they're trying to see whether there are
(03:10) still sellers left in the market because just because we have a break in a new low there still might be some people looking to sell so this is just the first entry but we want to wait for a second entry why you want to wait for second entry because it's just a human psychological thing once we make something attempt to do something if it doesn't work once we will actually attempt to do it again we will kind of confirm it if it really doesn't work and after it fails again we will stop doing it forever and this basically
(03:38) you know translates into trading as well so we have a first century short pullback second entry short now we have a two felt attempts by the bears to re-test whether there are any sellers left in the market and they are not the bulls are active so this is the second factor of looking for a reversal pattern and third factor is using the ema what we are looking for with using the ema when it comes to reversal pattern we are looking for prices to go through ema and then ema serving as a stepping point stepping stone for prices
(04:10) to react to so we have a first entry short second entry short we spiked through ema you can see how ema is holding prices nicely and it's not letting the bars to finish and in in addition here we actually have a short return trend line that is supporting our decision so this is a this is basically how reversal pattern looks we are working lower downtrend we have a break and a new low now we can be expecting a potential reversal pattern first entry short we're going through ema second entry short good is cma holding yes ema is still
(04:42) holding and we have the trend line now market is telling us that bears have abandoned their decision and both are jumping into the market and we want to jump with them and don't worry i have prepared a lot more examples for you guys i have quite a similar example right here we have a downtrend working lower you can see how neatly prices are fitting in you can see that ema is pointing up lower big time we are clearly in a downtrend we have a first break of this downtrend but we don't want to take the kind of trend trend entry yet we don't want to
(05:12) pick blindly big bottoms you never know if it's going to work or not we have to wait for wait for new extreme and we have break new extreme another lag to a new extreme okay so now we can potentially be looking for a reversal pattern we have a new low right here prices are working up higher first attempt to bears to test whether they'll sell us in the market and there and it fails we shut through the ema second attempt by the bears and it failed nice big bullish bar and notice how ema is holding prices and once again
(05:42) the trend line in this case is holding prices and this is opportunity for us to start trading in the opposite direction now if you look at the right side of the chart this is what it would look like the downtrend on the left side first century short second entry short we go through the ema and ema is holding prices this is a reversal pattern failed second attempts reversal pattern and not every time which i'm going to illustrate you guys not every time the ema we go through the ema so nicely like here this is the best scenario
(06:13) when the ema is putting no resistance whatsoever this is how you can trust the reversal pattern really well but i'm going to show you that a lot of times the ema is putting a little bit of a resistance all right here we have on the chart and bullish uptrend the series of higher highs and higher lows ema is pointing higher the trend line is fitting prices neatly you can see this is a valid bullish uptrend so we are looking only for longs no country and trendies trade entries for us yet whatsoever we have a first break
(06:40) and a new high okay so with the new high right here the rule of a trend line after new break is going to be a new high most likely now we can be expecting a correction at least correction or possibly a reversal so we can see we are working lower working lower we didn't take it higher here first century long and nothing happened we keep we we kept going higher and kept going higher so no reversal pattern right here we cannot pick any short none of this is a reversal pattern this is just a first entry and it worked it keeps going
(07:07) higher okay so we have a double bond double top right here we're working higher okay okay we pushed through the ema a little bit good first entry long failed second entry long failed big bears reversal bar this is good this is a two felt attempts by the bulls to see whether there are still bulls in the market ready to rally up market higher because you can tell that you can see that here the booths were still active in the market and they were still looking to go long after this double tap nobody was willing to go long and you
(07:37) can see first century long second entry long failed at least for this particular time period so this is two felt attempts after break and a new extreme and you can see how ema now is putting a little bit of a over a resistance but the important thing is that the we still manage to go through ema it's not like here when ema is not letting prices to close below we actually close below every single time and this is important for us and quick easy scalp reversal pattern right here we have a bullish option working up
(08:08) higher once again series of lower higher lows and higher highs trend line is fitting nicely you can see first break of this bullish trend line so what's going to happen most likely a retest of a new extreme two likes to a new extreme and now we can be looking for a reversal pattern pull back first entry pull back second entry beautiful slice through the ema basically like hot knife like a knife through a warm butter this ema is putting no resistance whatsoever we go through ema second entry long two failed attempts in
(08:40) the direction of a previous trend two felt attempts ema is rejecting prices trend line is rejecting prices this is all we want to see and only now we can go short only now this is a valid proven reversal pattern that is to keep telling us that bears are now in the market and you can see it doesn't apply just for the bigger patterns just not for the major patterns during the day it applies even for the shorter term ones because we have this dungeon working lower we have a break and a new ho new low and you can see we made a double bottom
(09:15) right here so we have a break and a new low okay our first rule is matt the downtrend is played out first century short second entry short failed the second rule is played out you can see the ema put a little bit of resistance here and put a little resistance here but the important thing is we are keep making above the ema we still close big bullish bar and close way above the ema and the trend line is holding at this point so once again first century long second entry long after a break and a new extreme and here you you can if you're
(09:48) experienced price action trader you can tell that we have a double bottom right here which adds even more fuel to the power to the fire right here so but this is just to see that not every reversal pattern is clean like this this is what we want to see spike through ema like it's not even there here a little bit of resistance but nevertheless it is a reversal pattern nonetheless and once again we have a trend line working up higher we have a break and a new high so now we can be looking for correction or reversal pull back first
(10:18) century long pull back second entry long two legs two legs down because market moves in twos it is off the trend line and ema is holding prices first century long second entry long you can see that our scalp would have gotten we we were gonna we would have gotten trapped here just to see it to go exactly where we thought we were gonna go but the key regarding this lesson is to recognize reversal pattern and this is a reversal pattern first century long we managed to go through ema second entry long ema is holding
(10:52) trend line is holding we are working lower from this point on and here we have a downtrend series of lower highs lower lows ema's pointing lower trend line once again is fitting we need to pay respect to the current trend we don't want a content trend whatsoever until we have a proven break and new low and even then that's not enough we need to wait for a reversal pattern so we have a break right here and we went into this consolidation into this trading range so we don't want to be looking for a longs we should be
(11:21) looking for shorts because we probably gonna go if you trade it down lower you want to be looking for shorts we're probably going to go go lower we're probably gonna break in the direction we traded into the range but nevertheless this is the new low because this low is still higher than this low so this is not a new low this is a break and a new low we only managed to make the new law after such a long time that happens new law right here pull back first entry pull back we crawl through up the ema second entry
(11:51) big bullish reversal bar two failed attempts ema is holding we have a break and a new law of current downtrend so current downtrend should be over and the trend line is holding reversal pattern now we can try to pick bottoms we're working up higher we have a break new high we don't want to pick top just like that first century long pull back pull back we spike through ema good second inch long here we want to go short and take our scalp first century long second entry long after this correction has played out so hopefully you guys are staring
(12:25) starting to see the pattern how to look for reversal patterns and that we just don't want to keep looking for counter-tension entries just picking tops or picking buttons we have to stick to the rules and we have to pay attention to what the price session is telling us just like here big bullish uptrend don't try to sell this at all just keep looking for lows we have a break we have a little bit even though even though we have a little bit trend down we still don't want to be thinking shouting and why because we don't have a
(12:58) new high you you can tell say that this is a potentially new high but this is so close i i might i might have my trendline just a little bit to the side this is so close that a lot of traders probably didn't even took this into consideration that this may be a new high and eventually they needed a bigger proof the clear new high so even though we have a current downtrend working lower this is just a correction we cannot short this because this bush uptrend is still in play we have a break new high right here and now we can finally be looking for
(13:33) potential country and trend entry but not any other entry reversal pattern entry first century long pullback second entry loan two failed attempts to go higher ema is holding prices we went through ema and the trend line is holding prices you can see we went a little bit shy here you could have waited trend line is holding prices now now is a good place to go short all right i have another example to you for you how you can recognize a reversal pattern we have a bullish upturn working up higher clear uptrend higher lows higher highs
(14:07) trend line is fitting very nicely you can see that this trend line is valid this is how you can tell the trend line is valid when it fits from the highs as well as from the lows not just from the lows you you need to fix from the highs as well two legs we have one leg second leg marker moves into this is a break first break new high okay now we can be looking for a reversal or potentially for correction or potentially reversal ema is holding resistance boom ema is holding resistance we cannot pick tabs here because ema is still
(14:38) keep telling us that there might be bulls in the market we don't want to go long either because we already already have a break and a new high so in this situation the best thing is just to sit on your hands and wait for reverse a pattern because we don't want to go long because we have a breaking new high and we don't want to go short because we are not going through ema new high right here first time we we went through ema okay so now we can start paying a little bit more attention first century long pull back second entry long reversal
(15:09) pattern failed uh the secondary long failed and we have another example right here let me see if i can find the trend line right here just copy it pull it over we have this big channel working up higher you can see this is an uptrend ema's pointing higher we went into a little bit of a little bit of consolidation we have a failed break lower we have felt break lower first break of this trend channel line working up higher break new high right here so right now we should be expecting correction or possibly a reversal first century
(15:53) long second entry long but look at this key entry point ema putting resistance holding prices the bullish momentum is still up so no reversal pattern for us let this we need to let the bulls to still because there's going to be a lot of bulls that are still trying to attempt to go along and we need to let them do this the balls are running up market higher higher we made it once again new height right here so let's start let's try again what we try to do here let's do it right here once again first century long now we're moving
(16:27) through ema this is exactly what we want to see not like here ema putting resistance here no current junction entry here ema is going through ema prices are going through ema here good fell second entry long right here first century long fell second into long two felt attempts in the previous trend direction ema is holding prices serving as a stepping stone stepping point stepping stone and the trend line is holding prices this is a reversal pattern we can go safely short now and we can now safely assume that the bears are starting to have
(17:03) more buying power more selling power because and you could make a case that picking tabs like this you can you can make it work and you can be a winner sometimes but what i'm trying to teach you guys is to find the highest probability setups as possible and to be as consistent as possible because yes you can pick a lot of tops and a lot of bottoms and successfully you know concentrate them you know successfully but it's a in the long term in the long run that's a losing strategy because it takes just a few of these
(17:35) trades and you're going to wipe out all of your account because you're probably going to keep moving your stop back and back further back or just even though even just picking tab just doesn't work because you could have went short like right here and look at how tempting this was tempting this look you can go show right here boom felt all right i'm going to go short right here the market is definitely reversing now trapped once again okay i'm going to go short look at this bull bearish pin bar definitely reversing now boom trap so
(18:03) you don't want to be trying to kind of turn trend you need to be looking for the reversal pattern when when the bears are actually telling you that they are now ready to sell and their intentions now are valid and i just want to show you guys once more that the finding a reversal pattern that this strategy is not just for the bigger bigger patterns during the day because yes that works the most and this is what we want to find the most to find the bigger the bigger trends how they are going to reverse this is the most
(18:40) important for us but it works for short-term trend lines as well because we have a trend line working up lower we have a break and a new low so now first factor key factor is math we spike through ema right here first central short pull back second entry short felt big bullish reversal bar e trend line is holding ema is holding reversal pattern we're working up higher this bullish trend is now working up higher creeping off the trend line we have a first break of this trend line we are looking probably to make a new high right here and it did
(19:16) happen 2 lakhs to a new high now we can be looking for a reversal pull back first entry ok we go through ema pull back second entry ema rejecting prices nicely in our direction trend line is holding reversal pattern now we can go short we have a break new low and a new low right here now we can be this is starting to look like a trading range so now it's obvious that we're swinging up and down up and down i just want to say that when if it's looking like a trading range picking tops and picking bottoms is a valid strategy
(19:51) but only in trading ranges but that's not the point of this video i just want to show you guys to focus on reversal patterns we have a break new law of this downtrend working up lower we have a new low first entry ema is putting a little bit of resistance but look at this bullish reversal bar okay we actually went up higher second entry big bullish reversal bar a lot of stem at the end this is what we want to see and the ema is holding prices we close above it trend line is holding prices failed two attempts in the previous trends direction
(20:25) reversal pattern this is what we want to see we don't want to go along here we want to go along here after the proven reversal pattern this is what we want to see so if you got any comments about a reversal pattern just put them in a comment section and i will get to them hopefully and don't forget to like the video if you actually enjoyed it anything this was insightful to you and if you are interested in learning price action feel free to subscribe to the channel i see you guys in the next video bye guys




(270) How To Use MOVING AVERAGE (MA) To IMPROVE Your Trading - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgIrZDR6uxs

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video i'm going to explain to you  how you can use moving average to improve your trading whether you're a beginner trader  or you have been trading for multiple years you probably have heard about moving averages but  how can this indicator assist you in your trading that's what i'm going to show you in this  particular video i'm going to be using as an example 21 bar ema that is exponential moving  average exponential moving average just reduces the lag by applying more weight to recent prices  just a side note 21 bar ema is the most popular
(00:33) moving average amongst professional traders  with that being said are you ready okay let's go the first way how you can use moving average to  your advantage is the trend identification when the ema is pointing down the trend is bearish  that means the market is making lower highs and lower lows and you should be only looking for  opportunities to sell when the trend when the ema is pointing up the trend is bullish that  means the market is making higher highs and higher lows and you should be only looking for  opportunity to buy this is pretty basic stuff
(01:06) right but how can you use this information to your  advantage well first you need to understand about the market is the fact that the trend never  goes straight up and never goes straight down there are multiple corrections and pullbacks along  the way and this is when we will use ema to help us identify high probability entries and when the  market is trending we as traders want to know when the correction is over and the trend is ready  to resume and this is when 21 bar ema helps us every time prices get to the ema we can expect  the end of a correction and the chance to get
(01:40) back and follow the trend you can clearly see  that every time price is touched the ema to trend resume and it resulted in a winning trade as  an example here here and here and here here here alongside ema here from ema here and bounce from  ema right here on the next slide you can see how much harder it actually is to identify  proper entries without using ema it's not that clear is it so this is clearly and you  know important information ema is very helpful for us this is much harder this is much clearer we  can see the why the bounces occur where they occur
(02:27) one more without the ema not that easy to see  and the same thing goes for downtrend every time prices touches the ema there is a high  probability that the correction is over and the trend will resume you can see bounce from ema  here market is making lower highs lower low ema is pointing down lower and multiple bounces from  ema are continuing in the trend so this is a valid strategy that a lot of professional traders use  and you you can use it to your advantage as well couple more examples here more  bounces from ema continuing higher
(03:09) and another example i have marked more bounces look at this so many bounces from ema  that are continuing in the direction of a trend so ema is clearly an important  tool that we use in our day trading strategy the second way you can use ema in your trading  is the fact that ema acts like a magnet every time prices get far away from the ema  there is a high chance of prices snapping back to the ema or just pulling back a little  bit professional traders use this fact to look for setups to pick tops or bottoms in  this picture you can see a trend working lower
(03:49) and look at this bullish bar how  far away it is from ema this is multiple multiple points and remember prices  don't stay away from ema for a very long time ema acts like a magnet and it is pulling prices  together you can see this is what the picture resulted in the price is snapped back to ema  just a little bit it doesn't have to be full snapback to ema but it is going to be at least  a little bit of a correction another example this bearish bar so far away from ema multiple  points and it resulted in nice snapback to ema
(04:27) even in this particular example resulted  in reversal another example right here this is very very far away from ema multiple  multiple points is spiked back to the ema and another example prices are very very far away  from the ema and prices don't stay away from ema for a long time the ema serves as a magnet  and is pulling prices together constantly you can see another example right  here how prices are far away from ema this is very very far away from ema and prices  will eventually go back to the ema in this
(05:12) instance you probably could have shorted this  but beginners should always wait for lower highs this is much higher probability  setups you won't get as big of a move but if you're a beginner trader you don't want  to pick tops or bottom you want to wait from high for more higher probability setups  and this is lower highs or lower low or high low in case you're buying but just as i  said professional traders use this fact to look for a setup to pick tops or bottoms especially  in trading ranges now picking tops or bottoms
(05:43) is very soft optimal strategy and should be used  only by very experienced traders beginners should in no way try to pick tops or bottoms until  they have learned to read the market properly the third way to use ema is what i call no trade  zone congestion this is pretty obvious just by the bar stacking up next to each other bar by bar  but every time you see bars stacking up and ema is flat in the middle of those bars the situation  is called congestion and you cannot trade this you cannot take trade in this you have to  wait for breakout and fade the breakout
(06:23) so in the first picture you can see prices bars  are stacked up next to each other and ema is flat and it is middle in the middle of the bodies of  the bars you need to wait for breakout and fade it once again ema is flat and it is in the middle  of the bodies of the bars this is no trade zone this is a congestion and you will get chopped into  pieces into this couple more examples first on the left side pre ema is flat in the middle of bars  the best way to trade the breakouts is to fade them the breakouts from these congestions once  again you have no trade zone here ema is flat
(07:06) it's in the middle of the bar of the bodies of  the bars and you want to break out and the last picture once again very similar to previous  ones bars are side by side ema is flat and it's in the middle of the bodies  so this is a no trade zone this is how ema serves you every time you see ema flat in  the middle of those bars no trade you have to wait especially if you're beginning trader and the  fourth way to use ema is for reversal recognition reversal recognition is a big topic in itself but  i'm just going to cover how ema helps us to find
(07:46) good entries when the trend is reversing the  first important factor when identifying reversal is that there has to be a break of a trendline and  a retest of a new stream after a new extreme when prices spike through ema the way ema holds prices  next is the key factor to entry so on the picture on the right side the trend is working lower  you have a break and re-test of a new extreme new extreme bar mark by this ellipse  and once the price is spiked through ema and hold back on the ema this is what i call  stepping stone this is a part of a reversal
(08:30) pattern you have a break you have a new new low  price is spike through ema and the ema holds as a stepping stone kind of as you are walking up the  stairs one leg up and your second leg moves up higher more examples here first on the left side  trend is working higher you have a break attempt to a new high this is a rules of the trend line  price is spiked through ema and now ema holds as a stepping stone this is of course upside down but  it's the same principle this is when you can use ema to spot reversal entries very high probability  setups once again trendline is working higher you
(09:11) have a break you have a new extreme price is spike  through ema pull back and serves as a stepping stone ema once again holds and you can trade  this entry in the direction of a reversal trend once again the last picture trend is working  lower you have a clear break and a new extreme this is the rule of the trend lines as a price  action trader you need to be familiar with price is spiked through ema and the ema holds as a  stepping stone as if you're walking up the stairs this is an entry for you this is  a signal for you when the prices
(09:47) are holding on the ema you can take the  trait in the direction of a reversal just remember indicators are just a part of  your skills to analyze the chart you don't want to rely on them they're just a tool in your  toolbox when you're reading the price action you don't want to solely rely on  indicators you just want to use them as a tool and implement them in many of  your rules i wish you safe trading bye guys




(270) HIGH PROBABILITY Scalp-Trading - Following Institutional Trading - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jA4ACcDviE

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on traders welcome back to my channel i just want to elaborate a little bit more on the video that i was trading live and kind of analyze the rest of the day but the first trade that i took was this second entry long but why was i looking for longs at that point well the day started looking as a trading range but the key factor to notice here is the big bullish move up when you work into trading range higher you can expect probably to break higher if you work into trading range lower the most likely
(00:35) break is going to be lower so at this point when i saw this big bullish lag move into the trading range even though we were quite close to these highs i was still looking at the opportunity to go long this channel has not been retested yet this was the first break of this channel working higher and it is a first entry pullback second entry long market moves in twos two like a pullback and it's off to ema ema serves as a key entry point at this point so at this point it was a good enough for a quick easy scalp now prices broke above this key
(01:13) resistance level i marked this as a buy side liquidity what is buy side liquid liquidity basically buy stops buy orders ready to go long on the break of the market and all these buy stops have been swept during this break they have not been purged they have been swept and what does swept mean well the orders are swept if the current daily bias current daily bias bar is bullish this is the daily chart and you can see that the previous few bars will were bullish so we can expect the day be bullish as well so that's why
(01:53) those orders were swept and not purged but i don't think you just want to go short on this first break higher because it's much higher probability for wait for prices to pull back and wait for a lower lower high at this point or overall this was a lower high from this point it is a re-test of the previous resistance i didn't take this trade as you obviously could have seen on the video but nevertheless i should have taken it it was my mental mistake it is a good good shot to go here and you can see you can draw the trend line
(02:30) you have to draw the short return trend line the prices are now working lower after sweeping of buy side liquidity you i've been now looking for shorts so when the price is bottomed out here you got a trend line working higher you have a break and a new high and this is a first entry pullback second entry so this is a two legged pullback to the trend line two i pull back to the ema so ema holds trend line holds and it is a second entry so three three key factors of the strategy are now screaming at you to go short here it was such a
(03:03) good trap that my limit order didn't get filled and i missed this trade but this was a good proper entry and then the prices came back retested made a triple top the correction once again working higher you need to draw the short term trend lines if you're the trader to keep you on the right side of the market you have a break you have a new high and the triple top is holding at this point and now i'm still waiting for a new low of this trend line actually the signal bar is supposed to be here single arrow and the market now moved down you know
(03:40) it was good enough easy enough for scalp but at this point since this is a trading range i am expecting prices go up and down up and down i'm expecting prices to go down here but notice this is very important notice how the prices didn't make it on the first attempt to these lows so this was you know this should have caught your attention and when the market second attempt felt as well to make these lows now you have to abandon your trading rules you know strategy and you have to focus now on going long because if this was a proper range day
(04:18) the prices should have easily bottomed down down here at this key level but price is two times failed and look at this big gap from the support you know this shouldn't have happened if there is enough you know barrel bears in the market and also this confirmed that the daily bus this is basically when you cut the dairy look at the daily chart you can now get kind of an idea that this really is probably going to be a bullish day so how do you trade it how do you find the opportunity to go along well the same as always you
(04:56) wait for key entry points and you wait for second entries so prices made a new low here they're working higher first entry to go short first attempt by the bears to go short it failed it serves as a you know beginning of you drawing your trend line prices are working higher above the ema the ema is holding it's not letting prices go down and trend line is holding and not letting prices to go down and it is a two-legged pullback on the ema on the trend line two attempts by the bears and market moves in twos always remember
(05:29) so this was a good opportunity to you know if you if you connected with the daily bass to go long you now confirmed the opportunity to go long and you can see prices are working higher higher at this point i always teach you not to go long at the resistance and not to go short at the support but why was this two-legged pullback once again always remember market moves in twos two legged pullback you you have a break new low it is off the ema ema is holding i just remove the ema and you can clearly see that it's much harder
(06:07) without ema to recognize where the prices are most likely to continue in you know after the correction to continue in the direction of the trade so i'm gonna put the ema back but the reason why is too like a pullback to the ema into the resistance is a good long it's because the fact that the trading range you know we didn't make it to the lower side we didn't make it to support we made a big gap here two attempts failed and it is a clear sign now as the prices spike through the ema that the bears have no control over the market
(06:44) so this was a good you got a little bit more room you know regardless but you know you want to abandon your bearish beliefs at this point from this point this was a key indicator that the prices are not making it to the lower side and the bears have to win the towel and this is what you can see the prices broke higher pull back at the key level prices will retest the key levels this is just a first entry for us as the day traders to go long i i'm betting you know there was a lot of institutions develop went along here but you know
(07:19) i'm a big fan of second entry so i don't think you want to go long here it is a very tempting but at this point yeah i kind of still think you want to wait for a second entry so you kind of have to watch it this setup to go higher and at this point mark is pushing higher higher a big time at this point market is feeling very over overbought so there is no surprise that there is correction but you don't want to just go short because you know remember the daily bias was up the daily bearish candle was bullish and
(07:51) probably two more candles before that so the only reason why i marked this short according to our rules is because this swing confirmed kind of not confirmed set up the trend line and we got a confirmed bounce off the trend line this is a first entry pullback second entry ema is holding trend line is holding i'm not the big fan of shorting this but it is according to the rules and you cannot parry shake cherry pick excuse me so i have marked this but since the daily bias was up you know i would be still waiting for
(08:31) possibility to go long at this point but you know after a big move like that you know this is very very steep steep move if you if you look at this this is very this is almost you know like it's like 80 degrees so there is going to be correction there is no doubt that there is going to be correction people are going to take their profits and they're going to trap a few more shorts so there is a you know chance to just get a quick scalp it is off to trendline and once again trend lines work phenomenally you have a break you get a two legs to a
(09:05) new low and notice this the legs are measured there is a ram and reason to everything that happens in the market and notice how this previous resistance now acting as a support prices came all the way back to retest this level and i guarantee you all the people that that miss this breakout all the institutions piled up right here they they just touched it barely and you know hesitations this must have been you know thousands of contracts institutions you know banking their orders right here waiting for prices to go
(09:42) back into this key level so once again this is no good setup for us to go long this is a horrible signal bar but once you trap all these people going shorter there's actually somebody going short into this you know proven key level and they don't understand how to read the price action and you actually once they once it reverse on them we can be basically buying their pain you know market spiked up on them this was a bad bad idea to go short into this key level you have a break of this trend line 2 lakhs to a new low
(10:19) you know this was a very good loan at this point now the prices are kind of trapping along through the ema the ema is flat and it's kind of in the middle of those bars so i really think you want to you know stay on the sidelines do it during this consolidation because the proper way to buy low and sell high you don't want to you know chase the market so i don't think even though it worked and it's off the trend lines few setups here i still think you kind of want to wait and once the prices came back and then you know the support is clearly now
(10:57) holding multiple multiple attempts you know and the daily boss is up these basic this is a double bottom triple bottom quadruple bottom these triple quadruple bottoms were good entries to go long in my opinion you probably would have been trading at this point because this was this is uh 21.
(11:22) 53 and the market closed 23 exactly so yeah this is only one hour before the close so it's not you know i recommend you not to trade before the close because you know the market can make some crazy moves but you know just remember the ski levels are very important to find and there is a ryman reason why prices are acting a certain way and that this was a big factor you know that the prices are now in a bullish trend because we should have clearly make it if this is a proper range we should have clearly make it higher and i forgot to mention this i've drawn this
(12:01) earlier which basically as you can see now added more weight to the to these setups right here so this there is a rhyming reason why prices act a certain way and if you study the chart enough and you immerse yourself in it you can actually you know figure it out how the institutions trade you can follow them this is basically what i'm doing i'm just a day trader i don't swing so i just follow the institution and i follow you know there's their steps because i don't know what they're gonna do you know they have the deep pockets
(12:37) they know what they're gonna do whether they're gonna sell or buy but i don't know what they're gonna do i just gonna follow their footprints and you know get a little bit of money of what their move that they making so go zoom in a little bit more the big shame was i missed this straight this was a good trap and at this point i was still you know thinking i could get a few more scalps to the short height but nevertheless from this point you have to reverse the daily bus is up and the trend is now working higher all these
(13:15) buy stops are now getting swept excuse me sell stops and uh that was it for for today so i'm gonna wrap it up just remember keep studying your chart this is doable and i'll see you guys in the next video have a safe trading bye guys

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on guys welcome back another video of price session trading and today we're going to talk about what to really do when you don't know how to trade the market you are very confused with the current price section you cannot really identify what's going on you're fairly confused because if you're just starting out trading there can be a lot of information you know coming at you from the market and you cannot really dissect it the way you want to so normally you know we are trying to identify the what the market structure is looking
(00:32) like we are trying to find the bigger patterns the bigger trend lines it is a trade it is a trading range day it is a downtrend or an uptrend but there are days where it's very hard even for experienced traders to really know what exactly is going on and the only solution to stay on the right side of the market and to really not get rolled into bad trades is basically to draw the shoulder turn trendlines and follow the shorter term trend lines rules it's going to recap it the trendline rules are basically saying that after
(01:06) the break of a trend line there is most likely going to be a retest of a new extreme so just as an example we are working in a downtrend lower prices broke the downtrend bull dungeon bearish trend and made it two lakhs to a new low let's measure these lags usually the lags can be measured this is not quite measured but as you can see these are two lags to a new load so from this point on when prices break the trend line and we made a new low especially two lakhs if you made one lag to new load there may be some momentum still going
(01:40) in that direction but after two lacks will be low now there is at least a correction or maybe straight up reversal and the same thing happens in an uptrend like this prices are working higher you can find a trend line from the first few swings and prices are fitting neatly this is the key to shorter term trend lines with whenever you're trying to find the bigger channels you can kind of get away with prices not fitting perfectly but when it comes to the shorter term trend lines you really need to prices fit nicely and you
(02:11) need prices to be hugging you know the chan the trend lines perfectly so just take a look how i drew these and pretty much all of them or at least most of them played out you can see this bullish correction working higher break two legs to a new high now it's time for reversal we're working lower we spiked through ema break big massive move to new low we reversed from here we're working higher brake new high this was the only time we didn't get a break and a new low and and there's a reason for this as well i'm going to get to this but this is
(02:46) because of the overshoot once you get overshoot that means the momentum in other side is going to be that strong that there might not even be a re-test of a new low i've mentioned it in my previous videos but i'm just going to mark the trades and let's talk about the trades so like i mentioned we started with the prices working lower break new low and then we're working higher and we spike through the ema this is normally a sign of a reversal pattern so from this point on this is starting to look like a trading range day we are moving up and
(03:13) down up and down even though with this break and a new high i still took this trade and when i was trading the bar i actually had much bigger much better and bigger bullish reversal bar after you reload the chart you can actually you know the bars may change a little bit but i took this trade because this is a according to our rules high probability trade this is at the key entry point this is the new low this is the new high pullback first entry pullback second entry it is at the ema we made a double bottom at the ema and
(03:45) we have a break and a new low of this correction working lower so i was really feeling it even though with the break of a new height this leg was fairly steep and they're most likely gonna be a second lag so this was a really good trade today because it is a key entry point finally we made a second lag to a new high so you really want to be careful you know you really need to stop thinking long at this point and you can see prices just kind of chopped around but you don't want to short this as well this is trying to look very congestion
(04:16) like and you don't want to trade the smaller trading range this is a congestion smaller trading range prices broke lower through ema we shot through ema and we pull back once this bar formed now this is the time when i drew my trend line and i just copied it lower and you can see it fits on the lows and on the highs so this is how you know the trend line is valid it fits priceless nicely and neatly nevertheless this is just the first entry from this point but once prices tried a second attempt by the balls to go higher
(04:46) and we got you know shut down from the trend line and from the ema this is a key entry point as well as and very high probability setup so even though the signal bar is not good i really like taking chance on this one but uh if you if you see the signal bar like this this is not a bearish reversal bar by any means so i guess you know you can be a little bit hesitant but the key entry point is so strong that you really want to take this trade and true to its form prices break the trend line and there you now are expecting to make a new low
(05:22) and it happened like prices most of the time do we spike through ema quite big big time so i might i was quite thinking we might not even retest the new low but we instantly the bears instantly you know sold the market and we just chopped below the ema and this is the first pullback below the ema i just marked it uh i didn't take this trade but i just marked it because after such a big bearish bar this is a huge you know rejection of all the bullish activity such a big bearish bar and we couldn't close above ema we didn't even close bill
(05:59) above ema so we are working below the ema so this is the good reason to take it it is a perfect you know bearish pin bar so for that reason i think it's really good but now with this second entry this is a new high pullback first entry pullback second entry market always moves most of the time moves in twos this is a two-legged pullback to the ema and bulls try to go along two times and once you know this is our human behavior once something doesn't work once people always try it the second time but once it doesn't work second time
(06:29) we're done this is how human psychology is working and this is why you know the second entry worked this way and this is why al brooks actually discovered the system early earlier you know 20 years ago because the human psychology never changes it you can see but now almost at the very end of 2020 the second entry is still valid nevertheless nice big bearish bar felt second entry long according to rules you want to go short here it was very tempting to take these shorts as well but at this point you have a new low
(07:01) and you're you know shorting the very low of this move and this is not this is not a key entry point this is not a high probability setup we want to wait for higher probability setup as much as possible so prices you know sold off massively i didn't really expected it to happen like this but nevertheless it happened and once again we spiked through the reversal look at the idle ema didn't even put any rejection we spiked through ema and the ema serves as a stepping stepping stone sort of prices pull back and step on this ema and ema is holding
(07:34) this is a reversal pattern and this serves as a set up for your trend line so you draw the trend line you put it to the other side and prices are fitting fairly neatly you can see the bitcoin from the trend line right here we have a break new high so at this point you have a break new high and a second attempt to make a new high and prices you know rejected the bullish momentum again so this is where you wouldn't be looking for shorts because this bullish correction has played out and this is the theme for the
(08:03) day the shortened trend lines are keeping you on the right side of the market this is it's very tough to find some bigger pattern yeah there might be something like this looking at this now but you know i don't think this is valid because it doesn't fit from the lows that much maybe it actually fits here maybe this is the bigger pattern that i just missed during the day but uh yeah this looks actually kind of bad this gives more credence to this trade uh i'm just gonna delete this because you know it's not that obvious to find this
(08:42) bigger pattern the shorter term trend lines will guide you safely during the day any market you trade so this is the new high we made this high is higher than this high and this high is higher than this high so this is the highest high of this move we're working lower first entry first attempt by the bulls to rally mark it higher and it felt it got rejected look how rejected strong it got instant spike through the ema little pullback second attempt by the balls to go higher and a second and it failed and this is
(09:12) our chance to trade failed second entry long once again similar pattern here first entry second entry new high first entry second entry so this is a you know the same pattern as this repeat pattern so you want to take this bar even though the bar is not perfect you want to take the trade right here because there's a felt second entry alone and this this correction played out with the break any new high and a double top from here it's usually working lower price is pull back to ema and trend line again but you know at this point
(09:44) you should have entered here at the felt second entry long and you really have to follow the rule because now even though it worked here you know you never know next time it may not work because this is just a felt third entry long and that's really not a thing you know this is not reliable setup so even though it's off to trendline i'm not a big fan of this i like only the higher probability setups and the prices work lower and here's a key moment that happened today i took this straight and i got trapped here
(10:13) and i thought i outsmarted them but you know they outsmarted me here because i knew once you have a overshoot you're most likely going to have a reversal to the other side and you're most likely not going to read this in your load so with this reversal there is a big chance that we may not retest the new extreme but so once i saw this bar once i saw actually i had to change my ema color my template is not saving properly i always it always you know goes back to yellow ema so as i apologize to you guys uh i have to you know save
(10:51) it properly i don't know why it keeps going back and i just you know i've been trading with yellow ema for so long that i don't even realize that it means i need to make it blue so it looks better on video nevertheless when i saw this bar i knew that i shouldn't take it even though it is from the ema and trend line i knew i shouldn't take it this is most likely trap but look how tempting this looked first entry second entry double tap at the ema trend line is still holding second entry short and it is perfect bearish reversal pin bar so even though
(11:26) i knew this would happen and you know this is the mental failure on my part i knew that i was gonna go i was gonna get trapped on this bar so i you know i was strong here mentally i didn't take this bar but you know they got me here they trapped me even more they really you know this was a good bait by the pros and unfortunately they got me here even though i knew with the overshoot i should be looking to go in you know in the other side but you know that happens in other direction so this is my loser for the day and
(11:59) once again you can draw the shorter turn trend line you're working higher you get a bounce from the trend line this swing served as a setup for the trend line and this you know confirm the trend line it is just a first entry but it is such a nice bullish reversal bar ema is holding trend line is holding so i think you want to take it and it the only reason you know i want you to take this if you had better signal bar because this is a first entry pullback second entry we triggered first here above this bullet bar and then we
(12:34) triggered here above this bullish bar so this is a two-legged pullback to the ema in the second entry loan but the signal bar is you know horrible but if you had better signal bar you know it's according to rules and you're waiting for break and a new high and once again it happened perfectly so this is why this is why the short term trend lines are very legit and you know if you're a beginner if you just learn to trust this because a lot of traders they don't trust this you know perfectly they are afraid you know to follow the
(13:06) short-term trend line because they're afraid that the bigger pattern might trap them but that's most likely not going to be the case the shorter-term trend lines are you know almost the most powerful tool as a trader you can have so definitely follow these short-term trend lines use them as much as you can and this was the bigger picture for the day you know overall it's looking like kind of trading range day but you know not that clean you know on the bigger picture and this like i showed this channel might be valid there's some
(13:42) validity to it because we are bouncing from multiple sides here let me see if i can make it yeah this is even better this is even better yeah this is looking nicely nevertheless so always draw the short term trend lines i don't forget study the chart after the after the fact so this is the way you will learn this because once you study this after the fact once you're trading in life you will get that flashback memory oh i actually saw this you know last week when i was studying my charts and you will be able to recognize it in real time
(14:19) you want to see the skill just like any other and takes hard work just like any other so uh hit the like button if you liked it this video if you think it was helpful and i see you guys the next video stay safe guys bye guys

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on guys welcome back to another video of price session trading and today we're going to talk about this watch pattern and why i'm not a fan of trading watch pattern but before we get started let's quickly talk about the current price action and current market structure that was happening we started this is actually yesterday's price action and yesterday was a martin luther martin luther king day holiday whatever in the u.
(00:30) s so market was close and you can see very little price action was happening and i found through the uh throughout my experience that a lot of times when there is a holiday and there is no trade day you can use the previous day's price action so that's what happened today i don't normally use previous days price action but when it's a holiday already is a no trade day you can generally use it it is because a lot of traders think that the day is not you know the day is not closed properly and the price action you know structure didn't really
(01:02) finish yet so it is still in continuation so we're training up higher we're trading up higher everything is above the ema we're making higher highs higher lows a legit uptrend so everything is looking like bullish so i want everybody to be buying this we cannot be selling this because everything is about the ema this is how we use the ema it is you know supportive indicator and at this point on is showing us that everything is bullish right now rebounds here from the ema from here from the trend line it was very early to
(01:32) trade so i didn't mark anything but here we get to watch pattern and why i don't like trading wedge patterns and i'd recommend you guys during which patterns either it is because during the wedge pattern it is very tempting to take the both sides of the wedge it is tempting to go long here look how it is bouncing from the lows and look how it is bouncing from the highest it's tempting to go from the highs as well shorting this look at so many traps here so when you see the prices going into the wedge pattern and you're not really sure what's gonna
(02:05) happen just don't trade don't take a trade sit on your hands be patient a lot of traders will get trapped very quickly and they will jump the gun because they're impatient and you just want to trade they just want to make some money but you have to be patient and you have to be mentally strong because when you're trading you should be feeling you should be leaning more towards one side you should always be only looking when you're buying you should be focusing on going along and you should not be even taking shorts into
(02:34) consideration of course anything can happen and there's always it can go up and down but my point is is here when the wedge pattern is looking like this it is tempting to go short and it's tempting to go long therefore you know it's a no trade for me and it should be no trade for you because when i'm trading i should feel like there's only one possibility that can happen this is how i know that i'm confident with my chart reading skills and using my rules so this is why i don't i'm not a big fan of the wedge pattern so just sit on your
(03:04) hands and you can see it actually happened we broke higher we broke the wedge pattern and we turned back down and i had this support drawn here earlier from these two logs right here and we broke higher and turned down quickly and this is where i went long and was a quick easy scalp but here was the important thing that happened for the day with that shift all the gears for the rest of the day or at least the majority of the day this one big move down that's normal we just broke the badge and it looks very strong but that's normal
(03:40) that's a fail break higher and we got back into this to the support so that's normal so i wasn't really that afraid of this trade but once we made it to the ema ema is holding prices and one it's more once again big gigantic leg down a lot of volume here this is now the indicator that everything has switched there the people who normally went long here and here they barely went long here and it was very few people that went along here i actually was one of the few people that went along here and they instantly got
(04:14) you know got trapped almost this is why i go for 10 ticks and you know i'm a day trader i'm a scalper i like to take my scalp and be back and be back you know with no position and so this was a major indicator that we are going lower from here and i actually took a chance here and i bought this one more move so i was one for one to start the day uh because i was looking at it as a little bit fail break lower it's not like ideal fail break lower and if you move the support even lower it is just bouncing off the support but
(04:49) i treated it like this and you can see i got trapped here i didn't have the trend line yet in play obviously this is all the trend line was drawn right after i got trapped here but i just took a chance here you know and you can see everything is below the ema you can see a lot of stems a lot of dojis big two legs down like this there's definitely some shift happening here there's definitely the balls normally that we're going along right here they're no longer going along right here the prices are not rallying up
(05:18) to this resistance so this is not acting like a normal trading range and we were looking for a new height of this bigger trend channel so but obviously it's not happening because look how look at how hard it is like pulling a teeth to take it above the ema and this is why we use the this is how we use the ema we cannot make it above the ema you know this was fairly small signal bar and i like to take these risks because the failed brakes felt breakouts a lot of times are the low for the day just like it happened
(05:46) right here if you took this field breakout you're holding a gigantic runner this is what i was kind of hoping right here nevertheless it didn't happen so once it didn't happen i drew the trend line you can see we are now working over and according to our price action rules we now are waiting for break and a new low so we have this bullish correction working up higher draw the short term trend line the trend lines the bigger trend lines are as important as the shorter term ones they are both equally important and
(06:15) don't neglect the short term ones they will give you a lot of great trades a lot of times they'll give you more trades than the bigger patterns bigger trend channels and you can see one leg pull back second leg two legged pull back i'm going to show you guys quickly one leg on the gap second leg up not quite measured but very close second entry short and you can see if you move the support a little bit lower it's now acting as a resistance and twice we touched it and we retested it i like this big bullish big bearish bar
(06:51) second entry according to our rules and we are waiting for new and new will happen right here if i'm eyeballing this correctly and if not maybe it definitely happened right here but right now we're kind of working up sideways we bounce from this support so draw the support definitely don't neglect the drawing this you can see quadruple bottom we're working up higher we spike through the ema so gears are switching up we're shifting i don't think you want to still go long yet because this is quite looking bearish
(07:22) and it's not really clear we have a new low whatever it's not really enough signal enough indication to go long you know so far we're now a little bit working up lower so draw this correction let it play out break any new high it was actually it was same thing to taking this long because the fact that yemen is holding prices even right here nevertheless i don't like going along into this resistance like here as you can see if you move it a little bit closer we have a break new high perfect price action trend line rules worked
(07:53) and now we have a new high first century long pullback second entry long according to our rules second felt second entry long that failed and it is also we can treat this as a second entry short we have a double bottom right here so you can treat it either as a first entry from this low or as a second entry from the previous low this is what i was counting it as today second entry short and i felt second entry long and you can see the shortened trendline once again holding prices nicely we take it higher traded up lower we
(08:26) close a little bit above the ema but the context is so strong right here it feels second to long i like taking this as you can see we have a break and a new low so perfect price action right here and now we are definitely going sideways we are in the trading range now and we have a field break lower so um looking back at this i didn't i didn't buy here but looking back at this it is very tempting to go long here um because it is a fail break low and most breakouts will fail first century short pull back a little
(09:02) bit of a sec too like a pullback to the ema if you if we trade it up higher and be close above the ema that will give me enough information that a lot of bulls are buying from here so i would probably go along here but since we closed below the ema you can still make one little push lower but you know it was very tempting going along going along here i'm not gonna mark it because it is very aggressive but it is according to our rules most breakouts of trading ranges will fail and they will just they will just move the market slightly lower to
(09:34) trigger the stops of all the people that went long so they can go along so they so they fake out the weak longs and the weak shorts the short the strong shorts went short right here and the weak shorts are going short directly into the support and they're selling the breakout which is wrong and the week longs they're panicking and exiting way too early so they know what they're doing institutions definitely know what they're doing so you want to be buying with them you want to try to follow them so this is what we do on this channel we try to
(10:05) follow the institutions but nevertheless i would play it safe here it is tempting to go long here fell break lower according to our rules i'm just not going to mark it because i feel like it's a little bit aggressive here nevertheless we're working up higher once again trend line fitting prices nicely ema's point time higher higher lows higher highs only thinking going along now bullish momentum very strong and this was the last trade that i took for today uh we had a new high right here pull back first entry pull back second entry i
(10:36) didn't go long on this bar because it actually we triggered first lower and then ended up going higher but it is still we're quite away from ema but once this bar touched the ema this is the key entry point so right now we are at the key entry point second entry long so now there's a two rules being met we have a break an attempt to make a new low the key entry point is so strong that we cannot make a new rules there is a third rule that is being met and we are waiting for a new extreme new high of this bullish
(11:09) correction working up higher not correction this is a very strong trend so there's a four rules being met there's almost all of these you know one thing that is missing is just fill breaker lower but this is a perfect setup very beginner friendly setup and it is a key entry point you can see we have a break and a new high perfect price action and this is what the day ended up looking on the bigger picture just be patient throughout this batch videos it is because it is looking very tempting look how nice the short setups look
(11:41) and look how tempting it is to go long of course it looks you know in hindsight it looks like you should be buying but you know it could have easily here it could have easily been lower and then go higher so you always just want to skip the wedge patterns because prices shouldn't be acting like this really we really shouldn't be going we shouldn't be this undecisive but a fairly good fairly strict dave according to our rules i took a chance here a little bit and but you can see where two big legs down stems below the ema everything's closing
(12:19) below the ema this is not how you wanna how you wanna trade this and i'm going to show you guys the way how i like to trade this the fill break slower and the support and resistance i'm going to give you a little bit guys a little bit of a knowledge right here normally once let's say we are working up right here we're working up right here we're working up like here we're working up like here when it is this steep the moves are big and steep like this it is safe to take these longs but when the market is looking like this
(13:00) and the market is starting to look like this this is when you shouldn't or you should be paying a little bit more attention and you shouldn't be going long here because there's definitely something happening and obviously i got trapped here so it may seem like you know hey thomas what the heck are you explaining us to you don't very far you lose yeah well i got a little bit i i jumped the gun that was a mental error but i instantly recalled you know that i made a mistake here but i just took a chance you know i
(13:33) sometimes take a chance even though i know i'm gambling a bit so nevertheless this is much safer and it is much harder for the beginners because all they see is just this one big move down and it is looking like it's going to reverse because this big steep move down is very steep and it's looking like it has a lot of power and people are scared to go long here but once we start wavering here that's when people want to go long but you can see this is not ideal pattern what is ended up probably going to happen we're just
(14:06) going to make these few little corrections we're going to have higher and higher lower and lower excuse me and what a lot of people will do luckily i didn't do this today but i remember doing this i once i blew my account when i started up i was trying to buy here and trying to buy here and trying to buy here and the way your psychology works is once you're trained once you're trying to go long each time here you no longer pay attention to the downticks you pay all the significance to the optics and why because the upticks are
(14:41) putting you away from the pain each time the you can see the uptick you you're starting to feel i it's all over now oh the mark is gonna reverse you know i finally gonna get my winning trade and once again once once it turns red you're once again panicking and you're looking for every single uptick you you your mind is only paying attention to your upticks and why is paying attention to your optics because your mind is trying to shield you from the pain you're experiencing a pain right now because you're working lower
(15:10) the market is going against your position and you keep buying here so your your mind wants to shield you from the pain so we have because we have a pain avoiding mechanisms inside our head just like when you put your hands on the stove you will move it up instantly that's how our mind works so when you go along here and you see an uptick that's how your mind works it is focusing you all you you put all your focus into the optics because the relief they're releasing you from the pain and you feel relief but market just keeps going lower and
(15:43) lower and once when i was very beginner trader you know eight years ago this is how i blew my account because i kept going short i wasn't paying attention to this downtrend that was happening and i thought it's time to go long it's time to reverse and you know i didn't go along here and i was going to go along here typical typical you know typical beginner error and you know what's going to end up happening is market is going to end up looking like this but nobody is going to go along here the people will go short here and
(16:16) here and here trust me and i saw this multiple times a lot of traders texted me and emailed me previously and many years back that they actually act like this so i guarantee one of you watching you acted exactly like i'm describing i guarantee you exactly like describing you took three longs right here you took a loser and you you lost so much money that the fear of losing money was bigger than fear of missing out than the fear of being wrong and the last long that you probably should have taken to make all the money back you didn't
(16:52) take because you lost so much money and this is how trading works and i'm rambling on quite a lot now but nevertheless uh hopefully this is a little bit useful i got a live trading session prepared for you guys so hopefully you guys gonna appreciate this i'm gonna i'm gonna upload it probably let me see today's third and this juice i'm gonna upload a thursday because i'm gonna move my schedule just a little bit because there was no trading monday so don't be i won't forget you know i make three videos a week normally
(17:19) sometimes four but you know just something to consider that monday was closed nevertheless hopefully you guys had a good trading day study your charts and i see you guys in the next video bye guys





(270) Tutorial for Traders: How to Read a Price Chart - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebULiDW6O70

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on guys welcome back to my youtube channel and in this video we're going to talk about how to properly read a price chart because there's a lot of advanced traders that are watching my videos and they already get the idea how to trade but there are also a lot of new traders a lot of beginners who take a look at a chart for the very first time and this is what you would see today and as you can see you know to to untrained eye this is a clear naked chart no indicators no technical tools anything like that and it can be very
(00:31) hard trying to identify when to go long when to go short you know when to buy and what to do market like this you know it's fairly hard to read so this is why i want to make this video to help you guys make it a little bit simpler how i read the price chart every day i'm going to start going through the process in my mind what i was doing today when i was trading and so first thing i like to do i like to use the indicator that is called 21 bar ema so we just plot the ema you make it 21 bars and i use this indicator
(01:07) as to tell me what the trend is if it's uptrend or downtrend to see how the prices are reacting to it if it's a trading range and also the ema keeps pulling prices closer to it every time you get far away from ema you see prices are trying to get to the ema every single time so this is just a supportive indicator and this is ema is one of the key entry points every time i'm expecting a bounce for prices to make a bounce it is either trendline or ema so ema is one of my key entry points other key entry points i'm looking for at the
(01:41) charts to take the trades that's what the key entry points are the key entry point just means that there are specific locations on the chart where there is a higher probability that the trade is going to be more successful and key entry points are trend lines ema and support and resistance lines so as i came in today i saw this downtrend a little bit and if you see like this you can see that there is some geometric pattern that prices are forming you can see the ema is pointing lower you can see each high is lower than the
(02:12) previous one you're making lower highs you're making lower low so this is a downtrend but i wanna even though i know this is a downtrend i still want to see where are most likely going to be the best setups so what i did is i drew approximately a trendline something like this and you can you're going to be tweaking the trend lines making fit throughout the day you know that's no problem you don't have to be perfect you just have to be close and what i did i just copied it and pasted it to the lows and you can see it fits off the lows
(02:42) nicely you can probably make it fit even more cleanly but i like it like this and you can see now prices are swinging up and down up and down and you can see trend line is acting as a support and as a as a resistance line so this is they're just slanted they're just tilted lining support and resistance lines and why am i using these trend lines because there's a rule in price action that not everybody knows that after a break of a trendline there is most likely going to be a retest of a new extreme and that goes
(03:13) for the bigger channels the main channels throughout the day and for the shorter term ones so not only my job as a day trader throughout the day is to find the bigger bigger trend lines to identify the larger trend i'm also using the trend lines to help me identify the shorter turn trends because they are just as important and remember what i said a few few seconds ago after break over trendline there is most likely going to be a re-test of a new extreme and this is a very important information that i'm looking for because every time
(03:46) i'm taking the trade this is the information that i keep in the back of my mind okay so now that you see that we are making a lower high slow rows we are in this downtrend and we are identifying key entry points i cannot just take any trade that i want i want to make i want to take the highest possible chance highest possible win rate trade that is possible the trade that has the largest chance to win and what i'm using is the pattern called second entries because market moves in two so you can see there's a lot of
(04:19) two-legged pullbacks throughout the entire chart there's a lot of second entries and it just goes back to human psychology it works in our real life and it translates into trading as well so what i'm doing i'm using the combination key entry points with the second entries and of course overall market context so as the prices bounce here lower from this lower trend channel line i'm naturally expecting for prices to get to the key entry point higher trend channel line right here and you can see what i did i drew the short term trend line
(04:50) just as i'm you know looking for the trend line so i drew the short term trend line and i have a break and a new high at this point on this bullish uptrend has played out this this bullish uptrend according to price action rules is over because after a break there's most likely going to be a new high which happened right here and that's all we had for this correction now this is the new law right here we have a first century short we triggered below this bar we traded up higher it felt and the second entry short happened right here
(05:19) now why is this is not a good trade to take because we are still looking for a new high of this uptrend working up higher first century short second entry short we have to let this correction play out play out break and new high and you can see at this point on one two three four touches of the trend line and we have a break a new high this is a key entry point nice bearish bar we are in a downtrend and i'm looking for prices to get to the lower side as well so this was the first trade according to price action rules and
(05:49) hopefully you guys can identify it and then as you as you can see prices traded out lower and now we bounce off once again from the lower side of the trench channel line we have a new low right here first century short pullback second entry short but why i did the market setup why this is not a good setup well it's because not only we are not close enough to the key entry point that is the trend line we are not even close enough to the ema so this was the reason why you have to wait and why you cannot go short into
(06:18) very low of the day notice how close you are to this low of the day yes we are in a downtrend we are making lower highs and lower our lows but you you are way far away from ema you need a deeper correction you are still way too close and then you just keep going lower and lower and lower behold we have a new law right here and you can see the trend is starting to see fairly strong right now we have a first century short pullback second and too short now why it is at the key entry point so this is good it is at the ema
(06:47) but why this is not a good setup even if this is the second entry just like the case here we have the shorter turn trend line working up higher we need to wait for a break any new high from this point on with the new high maid this bullish correction has played out and we can now go safely short we can sell the market and you can see nice reversal bearish bar but still it would be preferable to wait for prices to get to the upper trend channel line but this is such a good enough setup you can see ema is holding prices each time
(07:19) then there is no arguing that the ema is going to hold these prices and you can see that the move wasn't really that big we should have went much lower we should have made it to the lower trend channel line but you can see we prices found support right here and this is the case where you had to start being leery because we should have we should have made it much lower right here but we just only made it to this double bottom and we instantly reverse from here once again to this triple bottom now and we instantly reverse from here
(07:44) this is how you can see that the trend is available ring it's starting to lose momentum and you have to be you have to quit selling the market even this trade is fairly iffy it is much this trade is much safer this is a little bit more risky but still we have a break new high ema is holding prices and a nice bearish bar in and down trend but the fact that we bounced right here and we didn't make it lower you know this is an indication that there's some bullish support happening and you can see we broke prices however
(08:12) we broke the trend line but this is not enough reason for us to go long just because we break the trend line doesn't mean the price is going to reverse remember what i said after break over trendline is the trend line rule there's most likely going to be a retest of a new extreme and you can see we have a one leg one bullish leg up correction second bullish leg up we have a new low right here first century short we trigger one tick lower below this bar pull back second entry short but still we are inside of this
(08:41) channel right here so we have to let it play it out break any new high and we have a potentially short right here because we are waiting at this point on this bullish correction has played out with the break and a new high and we are finally waiting to make a new low of this bigger trend working down lower and you can see at this point on you can see that there is some resistance time to form here and this is what i was starting to eyeball when i was trading live this day that you can see there are some matching highs here we confirmed
(09:12) right here and you can see the next few lows they're confirming prices as well and this is the big indication this is the green light for trades that happen right here because once we made a little correction here we bounce from here but we found resistance again at the same at the same key entry point this is why according to price action this is a safe place to enter and now notice you have a double tap right here and you can count this both ways you can have a first century long pull back second entry long that failed
(09:44) which in this case it would have been losing trade and that's okay that will happen not everything is going to work you can see it you would have gotten stopped out just by one single take and it reversed exactly where you thought it was gonna go so first century long pull back second entry long this is a second entry long but we're not looking for second entry longs because we are in a downtrend we are waiting for a new low so we are looking for failed second entry longs because we want to go short so when this point in this particular
(10:11) case you would have gotten stop scout stopped out and you had another chance to re-enter because this is a this is a trap they trap a little bit more bulls the e we close below the ema and there's a big stim at the end of this bar and what that means that at the very close of this bar a lot of people started selling this is exactly what we want to see and we are still looking for a new law of this bigger downtrend broken lower so that's exactly what happened and from this point on once we have a new law right here after prices make a
(10:41) break and a new low new extreme there's going to be some sort of correction or possibly full-blown reversal so from this point on you should be really more literally not going short because you have a new law right here first entry short second entry short even though this is a second entry shot we already have a break and a new low and we are still inside of this uptrend so this is a no trade even though it is a second entry short choices have to let this one go without you and the same thing happened here first century short second entry
(11:09) short it is at the ema but it is very low at close to very low over the day you already made a big enough move for people to starting buying again so this is why you have to skip it again because you already have a break any new high you can see how the trend is starting to waver a little bit and we are starting to reverse and the first sign reversal is happening right here when the once the prices are rallying up through ema ema is not putting almost any resistance big green bullish bars working up higher you have a new high right here this is
(11:42) just the first entry so you just have to ignore this this is a new high right here you have a first century long pull back second entry long but this is a horrible signal bar this is a bearish bar so when we are going long we are looking for bullish signal bar so even though this is a tool i can pull back to the key entry point to the ema and is the second entry long you cannot go long above this bearish bar this is the safer entry to go long above this it has a little bit bullish tense to it so this is much safer
(12:10) bullish bar two like a pullback to the ema second entry long and important thing is we try to make a new low we have this one leg down pull back attempt to make a new low we didn't make it but it's okay because there's the ema and we are looking to make a new high of this uptrend so we have a break and a new high so once again the trend ryan rules has played out here perfectly just like throughout the entire market with this bullish rally up that happened just for a quick moment we have a break and a new high so from this point on
(12:39) once again the same story goes all over again you're just sticking to trendline rules and you're just trying to find second entries or failed second entries and we have a new high right here and from this point on with the break and new high we are supposed to be looking for some sort of shorts we have a new high right here pull back first century long that failed and that's okay because this is the first entry pull back we go through the ema this is exactly what we want to see we go through ema second entry long but now we are way too
(13:07) low below the ema we already have a break and a new high and this is now a felt second entry long this is exactly what we're looking for because we're trying to go short it is inside of this trend line and it is a nice bearish bar and in this particular case if you come from this low first century short pullback second entry short you get a little bit lower high from this high still below the ema still inside of the trendline key entry point good place to re-enter right here and perfect once again till the t price
(13:37) action rules we have a break and a new low so what does that mean yes once again the prices may go into correction or we are possibly going to reverse so the same story goes all over again you draw the trend line from the low so you can see how it fits nicely prices are working up higher you have a newer height right here three century long pull back second entry long we have a break and a new low so this bearish correction has played out we have a break and a new low second inch along nice bullish big bar and once again you even get a higher
(14:08) you even get a higher low excuse me a higher low from from this bar so this is how the market can get much more easier to read and hopefully you guys are getting a grasp that you have to draw these trend lines and you have to find the key key levels and if you draw the trend lines you can see how trading can become much more simpler and you can see if you just keep looking for the highest probability setup if you just look for second entries or third second entry longs the trading can become so much easier and you can really avoid a lot of losers
(14:41) so i'm just going to zoom out a little bit so you guys can see bigger picture and this is how it looks if you use price action rules if you use the rules that i teach you and this is how it looks without any you know chart reading skills without the ema without the trend lines you know nobody can really make sense of this you know this is so chaotic that nobody can really tell you where to go long where to go short if you don't use the price action rules if you don't draw the trend line if you don't use the ema
(15:12) as a supportive indicator so hopefully this video was helpful to you guys and see you guys in the next video

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on guys welcome back to my youtube channel and today we're going to talk about trading ranges because trading ranges can be very confusing and quite difficult to trade for a lot of beginners and a lot of new people because the beginner traders generally they like to see the market proven so when they see the market trending down like this they're going short directly in support and when they see market rallying up they're going along directly into the resistance and it's just a natural common thing
(00:23) because we like to see things proven before we make a move so this is exactly how not to trade trading ranges and just to clarify and the trading ranges are characterized by a series of lows and series of highs and prices bounce in between those lines up and down up and down and the first thing i like to do when i'm trading trading ranges i like to plot this 21 bar ema this is just a supportive indicator to kind of get to feel to know this is a truly a trading range you can see how prices are swinging up and down up and
(00:55) all through the ema but more importantly ema is constantly pulling prices closer to it so prices will not stay far far away for long enough far away from ema so this is why i plot the emi all right so the first thing i like to do when i'm trading trading ranges i like to identify the lows and the highs as accurately as i can and i found the highs fairly easily today because i use the previous day's price action you can see there's a key level forming right here and you can see it came into play right right this day
(01:27) and for finding the lows i use these few bounces here so you can see this is a clear trading edge and as i came in it was already fairly obvious we are in trading range we made the move down made a room up made a move down so we are in a trading range so how am i going to trade this trading range that i know the prices are going up and down up and down well the main thing is to avoid trading in the middle in the middle this is a no man's land and you cannot trade in the middle because most likely you're going to get
(01:54) chopped into pieces so the best thing how to trade is to fade the breakouts because most breakouts will fail irregardless what you have heard from a lot of people on youtube you know telling you buy or sell these breakouts no you have to trade them in the opposite direction because most breakouts especially in trading ranges will fail and that is the it is the hardest thing to do for for a novice trader but this is why it is so effective and there is even a little bit safer way to create the the failed breakouts and that's to wait
(02:23) for lower highs and higher lows which i'm going to show you in a minute so how am i how am i going to navigate this trading range well in trading ranges i definitely have to draw my shortage on trend lines because there is a rule in price action trading the after break of a trend line there's going to be a retest of a new extreme so as we are right now working up higher we have a break and a new high so from this point on after breaking a new high there's a time for at least correction or possibly full blown reversal and i'm going to do the
(02:53) same thing from the highs to the lows i'm just going to copy the capital line put it to the bottom you can see it fits nicely we have overshoot right here which leads to a break ninety percent of time we have a break two legs to a new low and i'm gonna do the same thing once again i'm gonna do the same thing once again i'm just gonna copy it put it to the other side we have a break and a gigantic move to a new high so this is how i will as a price session trader look for entries and look for places where i know
(03:29) it's safe enough for a reversal i'm not going to bind the lows blindly if we don't have a break and a new high all of these cases we have a break and a new high and what i'm going to be using a lot other than selling and buying the breakouts in the opposite direction to fading them i'm going to be waiting for a reversal pattern which is a very powerful setup and the reversal patterns are characterized with two felt attempts in the previous trend direction so if you can see if we are working up higher like this we have
(03:59) a break and a new high this up trend is over and i can be now looking for a reverser we have a first entry long pullback second entry long that failed this is a two failed attempts by the bulls to keep market rolling up higher and you can see how nicely it felt obviously this is still way too early in the morning so i'm not going to mark these trades and we're continuing working on we have overshoot right here this is the new law right here pull back first entry pull back second entry short and you know how second entry shorts are very high
(04:31) probabilities set up because we are waiting for a break and a new low this is a second entry short and a nice bearish reversal bar so it would be natural for us to start looking for shorts and notice how we have a one leg to new low little pullback and a second leg to a new lower and we have a little breakout you can see a double bottom right here holding prices nicely and we broke the support and we came back into the range and this is exactly what we should be looking for this is a failed break lower very high probability trade so this is
(05:01) the safest setup so far of the day and i know it looks fairly counter intuitive if you look if you look at the right side of the chart this is what you would see and you would see a big bearish selloff working down lower so it is fairly hard to pull the trigger right here but this is exactly how you have to trade it and this is why you have to trust our price action rules but in case you are way too scared to go long here which can happen and it's happening a lot especially to a lot of beginner traders who are still
(05:27) trying trying to learn about the markets you can find a safer way you can find a reversal pattern and the same thing we tried right here we're gonna try right here we're working lower we have a break two legs to a new low now we can look for correction or possibly reversal we're working up higher this is the first entry short it failed because this is not higher probability setup second entry short that failed once again here unfortunately we don't have a good bar so i'm just going to mark it only for you know as an example
(06:02) purpose if we had a much better bar because this bar is way too berry so we cannot go along about this and this bar is way too big so we definitely cannot go along above this but this is a reverse pattern two felt attempts in the previous trends direction and ema is holding prices this is a reversal pattern so this is the safer way how to trade the trading ranges and we're going to have the same thing working down lower so we can see we have a break a massive lag to a new high here you can make a case for selling
(06:30) this breakout and i will mark this because this is the same thing that happened right here we have a break and a new high and notice how far away you are away from ema this entire time you're so far away from ema prices will not stay way long away from ema the ema will pull prices to it and we broke the resistance we didn't broke below this bar we actually had to wait and break below this bearish bar and the bars were fairly big today so your money management had to be on point today and notice right here we have a break a
(07:05) new high we have failed break higher so we're expecting for prices to go back into trading ranges and we have a new high right here pull back first century long that failed pull back second entry long that failed gigantic bearish bar and this is once again a reversal pattern just like we were looking right here and this is how you can see why it is so consistent and why these trading ranges are not so hard to trade just like the reversal pattern happened right here the reverser pattern is happening right here first
(07:32) century long pull back second entry long that failed high probability setup we are coming off the resistance we are touching the resistance in this case this is unenterable because this is way too big of a bar so i just once again i have to mark it for trading purposes because this is just a ruler this is so big this is not even this is seven and a quarter point so this is no way we cannot enter this but this is just for you guys to see how reversal pattern looks in trading ranges and we have a break and a new low and i
(08:05) actually even like taking this second entry because you know just because we have a break and you look this early you know we're coming off the tops in a trading ranges and you're most likely heading to the lower side just like here just like here you're heading to the high side from high side to low side from low side to high side so the overall bigger picture is now taking precedence so you can pay more attention to the bigger picture and not to the smaller pictures and we have a second entry short that's coming off the top
(08:34) once again nice bearish bar reversal bar and you can see second entry short high probability set up coming off the tops you can see how we cannot close higher we just try and try to close higher but we cannot because we are in the trading ranges and same people who went short here and here and here they are still coming to go short in here obviously the trading range will fail eventually at some point or another and we make a sell off to a low side and right here this is where you would be suspicious after you see this bounce working up
(09:04) higher this is where your alarm should go off a little bit because if this is a normal trading range and this is a normal selloff we should make it at least to here or even lower even break lower this support just like it happened every single time on the left side of the chart we should have made it to this low side but we didn't there's a gap in between this so there's a lot of balls that jump into the market way too early and not that many sellers were still left into market so this is the first observation that you need to pay attention why we
(09:36) didn't make it to the low side the same thing happened right here same reversal pattern happened right here we have a new low right here first century short pull back second entry short you have this first break of this trend line right here so waiting for a new high felt second entry short ema is holding prices this is looking like a reversal pattern of course this is in the middle of the trading range so this one would be fairly fairly aggressive but the reversal pattern felt second entry short is such a strong pattern
(10:05) that you could make a case for taking a trade even in the middle of trading but the safest way is to skip the middle and just wait for these bounces off the highs and off the lows and here we would have a here we would have a trade that would have failed on you obviously you cannot take this trade but let me mark this you are now working lower you have a new low right here first century short pull back second entry short so you would be expecting for prices to go lower right here but you know just like a few minutes ago you notice right here that
(10:47) we didn't touch the support so this is the way how you could have avoided this but nevertheless this is a second entry short and this downtrend is now working you know it is in play so the second entry short is a potential setup the only reason why it's not enterable is because once again if you this is six and a quarter big bar because you have to put your stop above this polish bar so this is unentrable as well because i'm scalping and i teach you guys to sculpt for you know in this market for 10 ticks which is two and a half points
(11:25) and even two and a half points which seems like a big target for a lot of you it is still nothing compared to almost six and a half bar so you know today's market is very volatile nevertheless this would be a loser if you took it probably depends also it depends how the bar work would look on your chart because the charts can vary a lot but we didn't make it lower right here and we definitely didn't make it low right here so there is definitely some bullish bias happening because we normally should have been trading back to the support and we are
(11:57) not doing this so there's obviously a lot more people that are willing to buy and the sellers are not that prevalent so you need to kind of shift your gears here and you're working up higher and this is the trade that i actually took right here today i took this failed break higher as well now this was a not ideal bar and once we made another push small little double bottom this is where i re-entered and the market quick easy scalp it ended higher and right now we are starting to chop and you can see we are starting to go
(12:29) into small little trading range which is not uncommon because this strain range is fairly big and the volatility picked up a lot so we went into this smaller trading range and you have to trade it the same way as you would trade the bigger trading range you basically have to fade the breakouts and buy the lows and sell the highs but there also was pattern that i was looking at today because the way we did in the way we didn't come lower right here there was a bearish imbalance happening in the market and i made i think two videos
(13:08) about this so this is what the trend line what i was looking at this is what i found so i was more up to looking for longs even though you you need to play this trading range just like you would play any other so you need to short this failed break higher you have a double top right here even triple top with this top fell break higher nice big bearish bar you need to jump back into the trading range and i actually didn't have this trend line before this wing so i found the trend line once we found this swing this is where i drew the
(13:41) trend line here and this was the reason why i like taking this trade because the support is holding at this point on and i'm waiting for a new high of this trend line because after a break there's most likely going to be a new high so we are working up higher we have this two-tier channel working up higher and we have a break and a two legs to a new high so this is why i liked taking this long and once again off the lows just trade a smaller trading range just like you would trade any other trading range off the lows buy the lows and sell the
(14:15) highs and there would be second entry short you have a trend line working up higher you have a break and a new high so now you're expecting reversal you broke this trading range and on overall bigger picture you are way way higher than you should have been you know overall you should be really looking for a lot of reasons to sell you can make a case for selling all of these because you broke the bigger pattern and this is what you should be paying more attention so just to remember that these shortened trend lines are key if
(14:48) you're afraid selling fading the breakouts just wait for reversal patterns wait for lower highs or higher lows this is much safer and you can see how reliant it is and how actually effective that setup is and prices went back into trading range and you can see a lot of volatility it is only 1637 and we have so much bars in the chart and i'm this is why i'm doing this today early i have to get away from here um earlier so hopefully you will excuse me not marking all the trades throughout the day but once you see and
(15:28) now that the prices are going back into trading range you can see the volatility is so big that we have a full flown downtrend inside of this trading range so but that that means that you have to still follow the rules and you have to wait for second entries at key entry points so you have to find the trend line you can find a trendline from the lows put it here to the top we have a second entry short right here which is according to our rules but it is not at the key entry point and it is way too big so you have to skip this
(15:56) you have a second entry short with the set up the trend line but you don't have a break and at least attempt to make a new high of this option working up higher so you have to skip this one as well and you finally have a first entry short pull back second entry short it is at the key entry point we have attempt to make a new high break and attempt to make a new high so this is fine with us because a lot of times you will not get a new high if you are inside of key entry point so this is off the trend line and second entry short high probability
(16:25) set up in and downtrend now you you eventually have a break and a new high and you can see we have a first century long pullback second entry loan but we're not looking for second entry longs because we're in a downtrend on the other hand we are looking for failures for failed second entry shorts with if we are in a downtrend fell second entry longs excuse me we are in a downtrend so first century long pullback second entry long this is a felt second entry long we are in downtrend and we have a first break of this two-tier channel working lower
(16:53) so we are looking for a new low but at this point this is starting to look like a strong strong downtrend and you have a key level forming right here and you have a first century short pullback second entry short with a break any new high small little bar worth taking second entry short once again according to our rules you already have a break in a new low but this is such a strong sell-off this is so many points to this point 47 points so you can see the volatility picked up a lot so this is trying to like a strong
(17:29) downtrend so remember once you get out of the trading range you still have to wait for high probability setup at the key entry points and second entries at the key entry points you still have to draw short term trend lines and wait for breaks and new highs and you can be looking for failed second entry longs if you are in a downtrend so hopefully you guys enjoyed the video if you made it to this very end of the video hit that like button i would appreciate it and if you're more interested about learning price action you can subscribe

(270) How to Find a High Probability Trades while Trading - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVNSeqUS3Lc

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on traders welcome back to my youtube channel and on the chart we have a nice bullish uptrend and if you take a look at this trend you can see that there's a there are swings and for some reason you can see the prices are turning and bouncing away from here and you may be wondering why is that happening and how can you catch these swings and what is the reason why prices actually bounce off here and the reason is fairly simple and despite what many traders teach you the market geometry is very real
(00:34) and technical analysis if you learn it properly is very real so the reason why these bounces occur right here is this trend line and this is the tool that i use and that i teach you guys how to find this this is the tool that will help you to find these high probability setups because this is basically what we are on this channel doing we are just looking for the highest probability setups as possible and these setups are second entries with the trend at key entry points the key entry points are trend lines ema support and resistance lines and
(01:15) second interest why second entries it is because it is connected to human psychology when we fail at some things as a human beings in real life we will normally attempt to do it once more before we give up on this so the second entries are such a powerful setups big market moves into so you know this is a fairly common uh occurrence in market so second entries very powerful setup and so second entry loans with the trend we're in an uptrend and felt second entry shorts because we're looking to find the people who went short
(01:48) in an uptrend which is a mistake and they went short way too early so we're trying to capitalize on their mistakes this is unfortunately how trading works it is a zero-sum game and you i want to teach you guys how to be on the winning side how to be the smart trader so this is the reason why prices bounce off here and this is the reason this is the tool how you can effectively find these places to go long and you can see it end up working on the bigger picture and just to shortly recap the trend lines there's a rule of trend lines in the
(02:19) market in the trading and score trend line rules and that means the after break over trend line there is going to be more most likely a re-test of a new new extreme and after there is a rita souvenir stream it's like we have a break attempt to make a new high right here there's going to be a correction or possibly a full-blown reversal so that's the trendline rules but like it's like i said earlier what i'm teaching guys is just to find the highest probability setups as possible because we're even though this is an uptrend ema is
(02:49) putting up higher you know the bars are you know small and the trend is fairly healthy you don't just want to go long all over the chart you just don't want to buy all over the chart you want to wait for the best setups at the key entry points and just remember there are two things i want to talk about here when when you're trading a trend like this even though it seems fairly easy for a lot of beginners it is not the easy because they are way too scared and they they email me they are way too scared to go long deep
(03:18) at these pullbacks but this is exactly where you need to go long remember the deeper the pullback is the lower you buy the safer it is and the higher probability higher probability that is the trade is going to work so remember the deeper you go the safer the trade is the more you wait till market will prove because you will always pay a small price for additional information from the market market is not your friend and the more information it gives you you know it wants something away from you so there's always risk
(03:51) behind that if you get the more information market gives you just like for example right here you go long about this pullback and if you wait and you go along here you already missed a big portion of this move and potentially your scalp i mean hindsight it works here nicely so it seems like this was a perfect trade it was a good trade i mean don't get me wrong but it is a little bit more risky little riskier than to go long here because the more information market gives you you have to pay a little bit and you pay
(04:23) in the risk you take so let's start over what i was looking at i was looking at at the start i didn't know this was going to be a spike in a channel like this i early on i was looking for the shorter term trend line something like this or something like this or i was moving in the round something like this but we end up swinging up and down up and down and it's starting to like we have a one leg and price is just kind of consolidated and the trend you know get a little bit more shallow a little bit more narrow and once we bounce right here this is
(04:58) where i drew the trend line once we bounced right here i didn't have to trend line in place yet but with this bounce with this rally off right here this is the three touches off the trend line so i copied it put it to the top and this is this was the trend line that i found but okay now that we know that i'm looking for second entry longs or failed secondary shots at key entry points i also need to pay attention to these corrections i also need to draw the trend lines because they work the same way as the bigger pattern don't neglect short-term
(05:26) trend lines they work the same way as the bigger pattern i am paying attention because i want to know where exactly can i go short because sometimes it excuse me where i can go along where i can keep continuing buying and this is why i truly shortened trendlines to know that there is a break of this trend line and a new extreme so let's start off right here we have a new high working up lower we have a break and a new low from this point on i can expect some sort of bounce over here and i can be looking for reasons to go long
(05:58) we're working up higher once again two-legged move first lag consolidation second leg we have the straight line working lower we have a break and new low okay now it is safe for me to start thinking going long because this correction has played out this bearish downtrend even though it is shorter than one it is still a downtrend and it played out and i need to respect this and at this point on it doesn't seem like a strong market yet so i really need to pay attention to this and we have a new law right here first
(06:26) entry short pullback second entry short fourth bounce off the trend line second entry short let me grab the arrow i didn't delete all of them this is the second entry short that felt the bar has when we are going long we are obviously looking for bullish bars as as bullish as possible and even though there is a one tick bearish body it's still a bullish bar because look at the tail look at the wick this is a reversal bar and we traded up lower during the bar and at the very close we traded up higher so there was a bullish
(06:58) activity in there was a bullish power buying power happening at the very close this is what i want to see so two felt attempts to go short and we're bouncing off the trend line so good setup right here high probabilities high priority setup and there is now we have a new higher here and this is just a first entry so this is not second entry but even though it is the first entry you cannot ignore how many times you already bounced the trend line and it's so valid the trend line is so valid you have to take a chance you really do
(07:28) and this is the higher low because notice how you push through ema the ema is putting no resistance and you pull back ema's holding prices nice reversal bullish bar the safer it is to go along here here you what can happen is you can push a little bit higher pull back a little bit lower and you can get stopped out and then go higher just to see where you thought it was going to go so remember you want to buy these pull backs it is scary i know it is counter intuitive this is why trading is difficult because people
(07:56) think they see the market reversing in the opposite direction and they think market is reversing but no we're just trapping we're just trapping the people who don't know what they're doing and we're taking advantage of them so market is trading up higher and we don't want we don't want to go long here why we are not at the key entry point this is not higher properties high probability setup anything can happen here even though it would have worked we are in the middle of the trend channel you're not even close to
(08:21) the another key entry point which is key ema exponential moving averages 21 bar ema skip this you have a new high right here you push through the ema and you try to go long but you're not close enough to the key entry point and this is the first break and i was expecting a new low right here and take a look how ema is flat this is a congestion this right here what you see is what i call congestion the ema is flat it is exactly in the middle of those bars the bars are stacked next to each other you cannot go both highs both lows and
(08:54) the only way to trade this is to fade the breakout but we broke higher but you you don't want to fade the breakout to sell this because this is an uptrend so if we broke lower you want to fade the breakout that way you you want to go along here and even though this is a congestion and you want to skip taking trades here it still would have worked yes but i would be okay buying this congestion if we touch the trend line if this lag continue lower and we bounce off trend line then it will be okay to take in a shot
(09:25) because this trend is starting to look fairly strong you have a new high right here you have a pullback first entry long pull back second entry long second entry long trigger one take higher above this bar but once again you're far away from key entry point so even though this is a second entry long it is a doji bar so not a good bar either to take and this was the proper trade we touch the e one touch the key entry point once again you have a break and a new low so this downtrend is over so i can safely be looking for longs which is what i want
(09:52) to see when i'm focusing and you can see how market reverse from me and you get another chance you actually get a look at this nice bearish bar somebody actually sold this market directly into this trend line they were look they if you don't have to trendline in play it may seem pretty tempting but this is why i teach you guys how to find this how to this will give you and such an amazing edge and they trapped all the shorts higher low this is the higher low of this trade the same way this is the higher low of this trade one more push lower
(10:22) higher higher trend line still holding this is what you want to see you get another bounce of train line but at this point on this is a gigantic bar you would be risking a lot of money and you can see how market is starting to look fairly strong here and this is why um i actually took this trade and i had a loser right here this is the new high first century long pull back second entry long and you i knew that i was taking a chance that we are we need to make a new low but i was you know betting and i was you know taking my chance that this
(10:55) market is starting to be so strong that you might not even get it to the trend line so i took a chance right here i got stopped out and i actually re-entered exactly on this bar because i had to re-enter here this is the another bounce off the trend line you have a break attempt to make a new low and it is a fail break lower you can see that this congestion right here once again go check the video about the ema i talk about congestion ema is flat in the middle of those bars bars are stacked up next to each other
(11:24) and the only way to trade it is to fade the breakout you can see you you broke lower this is why there's such a stem here but it's such a wake you broke lower and then trade it up higher and it's off to trend line nice bullish bar take it straight according to our rules and market is really starting to look strong but once again i'm drawing these trend lines new high right here pull back first century long pull back second entry long right here you have a break and a new low at the key entry point at the ema so this was a good trade i didn't take
(11:58) this trade unfortunately and then you have a tool like a pullback first lag pull back second lag to the ema i tried to take this trade but i put my limit a little bit back and prices didn't fill the limit order and continue relab without me so that happens and once again you have a first century long pullback second entry loan at the trend line so uh i didn't take this trade and i was afraid of this trend line but this is the point this right here i was really respecting this this trend lines and waiting for a new
(12:34) low breaking new low because now it's not sure that this is an uptrend and it's not strong but as the day goes on you can see the trend is getting stronger and stronger the bars are smaller and smaller and the trend still keeps 45 degree angle this is a healthy trend the trend that goes 90 degree up or something like that it's not healthy healthy is if it's you know somewhat flat 45 degree angle this is a perfect perfect trend health 45 degree angle this is the perfect health healthy trend so remember don't get you know don't
(13:11) expect trends to last if they are very steep they're not going to last like that and i actually took this first entry right here because once again we bounce the key entry point it is just the first entry but you know the market is so strong you just have to take the chance and you have to buy these deep pullbacks once again deep pull back deep pull back you have to be willing to take the chance and you have a first entry short you rally through the ema second entry short we touch the key entry point ema is holding
(13:41) reversal bar according to our rules high probability setup failed second entry short excuse me and you have a break and a new high so you can see price action works to the t and this is the bigger picture so hopefully you guys get the idea how you should be looking for the best trades how to find the best trades wait for second entries let these shorter turn trend lines play out and trading can become very simple you don't need no fancy indicators you don't need to find the perfect combination of 300 indicators and you know wait for
(14:15) arrow here wait for a signal here you know stochastic ichimoku cloud it all sounds fancy but it's created and it's marketed for people who don't know what they're doing and they're selling a lot of you know junk because that's what tells but this is actually how you make the money if you learn to read the chart and this is actually this is such a good day that we don't get a lot of days like this because we as a day traders we would like to have this day every single day because you could really make a ton of money on the day like this
(14:45) trading is so easy on a day like this you can make a month worth of profits on the day like this but we normally get like one or two big trends up or down where you can really capitalize and really make some money but you know take advantage of these days and if you just follow the rules you almost cannot go wrong even though i took a loser here you know the loser was nothing compared to the winners that i had so you know trading is a game of arts and i my goal here is to teach you guys how to put your odds on the
(15:19) on your side how to be the casino you don't want to be the people who's playing the slots you want to be you want to be the owner of the slot machine so you have the odds on your favor and this strategy gives you the odds on your favor on your side in your favor so hopefully you guys enjoyed the video if you liked the video if you made it to the very end please hit that like button i would really appreciate it and if you are interested in learning about trading and how to make money in trading uh feel free to subscribe uh

(270) SHOULD TRADERS TRADE NEWS? | Stock Market Technical Analysis - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbzdZ-JH64k

Transcript:
(00:00) should traders trade the news this is what we're gonna talk about today so please take a seat because today at seven o'clock we had an fomc announcement with which caused this massive bullish rally up and i used to get a lot of questions earl back in the day from traders whether it is safe to trade this news the big news the big announcement what kind of strategies are there to trade the news is it is price action even legit does this strategy even works during the news so let me just start off with this the price action
(00:32) is still valid and works just as every other day during the news the only thing that's going to be different is probably the volatility depends how impactful the news are but if it's if the news are very impactful the volatility you know obvious is going to increase but should we trade the news is it even worth it and my general opinion is to skip trading news completely because it is simply just not worth it uh you know nobody knows what's gonna happen because this is just a game of those big big hedge funds big institutions you know goldman says
(01:09) they know and they're planning what they're gonna do way ahead before the news you know people thinking that they're gonna predict the news safely it's just not gonna happen this is just a big players game and the safest way to play this is to wait uh way through the storm let them do their thing and the price action is still valid but start trading like 10-15 minutes after the news and stop trading 10 to 15 minutes before the news so before the news are going to be announced for like 15 minutes i would recommend for you to stop trading
(01:42) because you guys can see what's going to happen it is happening every single time when there is a big fomc announcement being you know predicted the market will usually go into this consolidation this is exactly what we have this big consolidation and market is really unsure people are sitting on their hands they're waiting and if you trade during the news the volatility is so so big you can get a lot of slippage that's your stop loss will be way too big so just avoid training the news all together wait 15 minutes after it's a little bit
(02:14) settle down and then you can take their you know your trades and you know just wait 15 minutes before the start to stop trading exit your positions because you know i used to hang around when i was starting trading i used to hang out in trading view and there's the chat rooms and all these people all all those beginners they used to post their strategies and what they were trying to do you know some of them they're trying to put their small stop loss at the top and gigantic target profit at the bottom while simultaneously opening another position
(02:43) with stop loss at the bottom and a huge target profit at the top so it looked good on paper and they were trying to basically when they you know put all these trays together the net sum would be profit but you know what they don't take into consideration that the slippage is going to happen when the volatility is so big like this there's gonna be a lot of slippage and their stop loss is going to be twice as big even even three times as big because of the slippage this is why it's not safe to trade and also what's gonna happen a lot of times
(03:16) it will market will go high enough but it will not quite reach their target profit and they it's go back hit their stop loss and maybe then go in the opposite direction this was happening so much this is very unusual when we go just one move like this in the favor you usually will go a little bit up and down before we push higher or push lower so you know all these people are trying to outsmart the market listen guys you're not gonna outsmart the market this is the big players game they know what they're doing they know
(03:44) ahead what they're gonna do and a lot of times they write to news just to fit the price action you know whatever you hear on cnbc talking about the news gonna cause this news gonna cause this normally you know it's it will all relate to price action what's happening on the chart because where is that information where is the source that they get their information that is doing exactly what they they are saying they're just looking at the chart and they're describing the chart and the reason why uh the price action
(04:12) still works even during the news it's because uh it's still tied down to human psychology you know the humans they're every single person who trades and they're whoever is placing their trade they're expecting to be winner otherwise they won't be you know putting their order in so everybody expects to be a winner and they have a reason they they made their analysis they have their opinion about what's most likely going to happen so everything is thought thought out and nobody is just blindfolded throwing darts at the board
(04:42) and buying or selling blindly that's not happening every single person they're using some sort of analysis some sort of judgment so this is why the patterns still repeat over and over this is why the price action still works because human psychology is still the same and this strategy is tied down to human psychology and only way this is not going to work is like when thanos will snap and you know will completely redesign human psychology so avoid trading price action uh avoid trading news early while the news
(05:14) are happening and you guys can see while while we had this rally we have a new high right here we have a two like a pullback so we are we have this one leg higher you have one leg lower pull back second leg lower the legs i guarantee you they're almost measured this is the first leg a little correction second leg measure second leg to the take two like i pull back this correction is is over because the a lot of people there they took their profits and look how far away you're from ema this is why i keep telling you that you can use this ema
(05:46) as a magnet because ema keeps pulling prices closer to it so look how far away you are from ema and from this point we have a two like a pullback break and a new low it's now safe to be looking to go long we have a first century short that failed second entry short that failed bullish bar ema's holding play for prices this is the setup just like any other setup you know price action still works even if it's after the news so you know it is definitely legit and i want to show you guys one more thing just take a look at this
(06:17) pattern we we trade it down in a little bit of downtrend we we went into this trading range so downtrend into trading range we broke lower made few legs lower lower than we are reversing we have a little bit of an uptrend which played out a little bit of correction and then we rallied up higher and now watch this this is like a month ago price action watch this we have a downtrend working lower i specifically found this because i knew i saw this you know somewhere in my mind so this is like a month ago and we have a price
(06:48) action working lower downtrend working lower we bent into this trading range so this is a downtrend into trading range we made a push push lower we made them one more like lower then we have this uptrend just like we had today we have this uptrend you can copy put it to the top we have a break new high you have this little bit of a bearish correction and then you rail up higher this is basically the entire foundation of what happened today happened even on this day you're working lower into trading range you broke the trading
(07:18) range you're working higher brake new high bearish correction and rally up higher same thing happened today you're working lower trading range you broke lower you have this bullish correction new high bearish correction and then a new high of course the moves are going to be a little bit different but you can see the overall pattern is very similar it's almost identical exactly what happened and this is why the price action works and this is why you know the news they just reflect what the big players are are going to do and the best way for us
(07:53) is just to follow those big players it is not worth it to us whether you know federal reserves have some positive prognosis you know whatever you read or whatever you think is going to happen let them do their thing and we're just going to follow them safely and just like here we we're going to take a high probability setup because we know how they're trained and we're just following their footsteps and we're just going to follow the rules takes nice some nice high probability setup and it's going to work out at the end fine so hopefully you guys
(08:21) you know understand that the news you know let them talk whatever they want to talk doesn't really matter whatever they say whatever fmc you know the chairman is saying doesn't matter i think he can be pulling you know information out of his ass frankly because the price action will still reflect the human nature and it will never change you can see this will never change this pattern is very similar two months ago and this pattern happened 40 years ago so it will never be outdated but two i don't want to make
(08:53) this video way too long so i marked the setups according to our rules you can see we are working over we have a first break so we are expecting for prices to make a new low and this would be the one trade you probably would have gotten trapped here because we have a new high right here first century long pull back second entry long they failed but you did this was just a trap and you would have gotten stopped out here uh just for whatever reason and then you had the chance to re-enter and get your money back and even more
(09:24) because we are still looking to make a new low of this downtrend according to trend line rules so we we're working over train ride broke we are expecting a new low first century long second entry loan that failed but you had another chance sometimes they like to fake out these people it doesn't happen often i'm actually surprised it happened right here but it happens and then you have a you actually don't have a new lobe because we are one take higher right here but you bounce over here it looks like a new low it is close to being a new low it is
(09:53) a double bottom right here first century short you push through the ema second entry short reversal pattern you are coming off the support two legged pull back second entry shoulder failed you have to go long here because we're expecting for prices to reach this upper resistance you have a break two legs to a new high perfect price action and i like this setup even though it is just the first entry and we are waiting for second entries it's a high probability setup because you have a now clearly defined resistance
(10:24) three tops right here that clearly fit and the way i like the way we push through ema this is such a gigantic leg down and you have a nice pullback to the ema ema is holding prices to the t i think it was worth taking a shot here just because it is such a nice breakout pullback sort of it's such a nice move down and you know you're expecting probably to move to go lower because you should have been trained up higher there is almost no bullish activity happening each time you go higher you just make one little move you
(10:56) instantly slap back one little move you instantly slap back so yeah even though it's just the first entry it is a little bit aggressive you may skip it because you want to probably wait for second entries and i agree but you know i still this trade is worth taking a shot then we have a definitely new low and the reason why i like taking the second entry short we have a double bottom right here first century short second entry short at the ema support is acting now as a resistance i like taking it because of what happened on this day
(11:30) because you you as well have a new low right here you have a first century short second entry short but you're far away from ema it went way too close to the lows and you push higher and you wait this you made this one more leg down and this is exactly why i like taking the second entry short at the ema because the price accident just worked like that and you guys can see now we have this break and a new low and you're expecting probably a reversal or some sort of correction and you guys can see we have a first century short we
(12:04) we creep a little bit higher above the ema second entry short that failed but unfortunately there was no way for us to enter because this bar is way too big air going long already at the very high so but you get the next chance when the ema is holding prices trend line is holding prices uh it is a key entry point two key entry points that are merging which is perfect for us we are looking for a reversal pattern and we are looking for prices to overall reverse from here because we have a break new low one more like to a new low and we are
(12:35) moving above the ema we are working up higher we have a new high right here first century long pullback second entry long two legged move once again break and a new low so this correction has played out we have to draw a shortened trend lines for this correction to play out two like a pullback second entry long be close a little bit above the ema or at the ema but we're expecting a new height of this option working up higher according to our rules break new high we're working up higher and now this uptrend has played out we
(13:10) have a break two legs to a new high we pushed through ema we have a first century long pullback second entry long that failed you know good setup to take because we are waiting for a new low of this shortened trend line and we got a new low and this was you know at this point you don't really know uh it's gonna look congested because it doesn't look congested at all and you still got some time before the em fomc but at this point on you know the prices will go into consolidation and a lot of people will wait and just be careful because you can
(13:43) get and i would even exit the runners here that's my for example if you went short right here and if you hadn't gotten stopped out or you kept your stop want to give up here or whatever management you use exit even before the news i know it is very tempting to the notion that you can catch a gigantic runner but you know this if you run around wrong side you can have a slippage and it is not your broker's fault and the brokers the broker is innocent here because um that's just the volatility got spiked up so much that you know whatever
(14:21) broker you're using you're gonna have a slippage most likely when you're holding the position during the news and this is the trade that we already talked about two-legged pullback this downtrend played out so now that our you know thoughts about going along are resuming here you push through the ema to like a pullback second entry shot that felt and ema's holding prices nicely and voila perfect price section to the t uh so yeah i apologize i run through the trades a little bit too quickly but we talked about the news and i don't want this
(14:59) video to be way too long so hopefully you guys a little bit smarter or actually you guys know my opinion about the news so you can do with it as you please so i'm gonna see you guys in the next one bye guys





(270) How To Filter THE BEST Trades With Trend And What To Do When Trendline Breaks (Beginners Guide) - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5HqLD8kcRc

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on traders in this video we're going to talk about how to find high probability setups at the trend line and what we should be expecting and how we should be reacting when we see a trendline break so we have a two-tier channel working lower this is a downtrend prices are making lower highs lower lows and there is a rule in trading that we should stick with the trend so which is obvious everybody knows this rule you probably read it in all the forums and all the trading books so we are be sticking with the trend
(00:27) because this is a valid information valid rule but i've got a question from a trader asking me whether we when we see prices reacting and reaching close to the trend line do we sell blindly the trend line expecting prices to reverse off the trend line and the answer to this is no it's a big no because we want to find the highest probability setup as possible we don't want to take losers that are you know unnecessary so the way we filter the trades to make them as high of probability as they can possibly be there are a few criteria that we need
(01:03) to meet in order for us to take this trade i mean there are there are a few traders who can put a resting limit order at the top at the trend line and hoping and to get a scalp but you know that is not reliable that only works sometimes and the best way is to wait for prices to confirm the trend line because we want to see that the the traders have the same intentions as us we want because we are following the big institutions and we want to see that the institutions are really sticking to their guns and their intentions are really keep selling
(01:34) the market off the trend line so the first thing we need to do when we are trying to find the highest probability they set up at the trend line is we need to pay attention to the previous trend in the opposite direction to the counter trend trend because there are going to be corrections we are in a downtrend and prices is making the small bullish corrections working up higher you guys can see it on the chart it is mostly people taking their profits but there are also some people who are actually trying to pick bottoms
(02:02) even though this is a downtrend i mean whatever reason they have doesn't really matter so there are these corrections these kind of trend trends they're working higher and the best way so we can filter the safest setup is we need to wait for a break and a new highs because these corrections they're small trend lines there are a tiny little trend inside of this bigger trend and the true rules of the trend line applies as well to these tiny little trends and the rules is after break of a trend line there is most likely going to be
(02:34) rita's of a new extreme so when we see these bullish corrections these bullish country trends in the downtrend working up we need to wait for a break and a new high after break after prices break and don't worry guys i will make the chart a little bit bigger soon but i just want you guys to see a bigger picture after a break of these smaller canon trend trends there's going to be aritas of a new extreme and when the price is re-tested with a new extreme then it's safe for us to take the trade and this is one part
(03:04) of high probability setup and you guys can see if you're just a little bit patient here price is broke this uptrend working higher and you have a new high and the setup at the trend line price is working up higher here you have a break and a new high prices and you have a setup at the trend line so we are waiting we we just don't blind don't sell blindly or don't buy blindly in an uptrend we want to see the signal bar at the trend line and the signal bar in this downtrend should be as bearish as possible some nice bearish reversal bar
(03:35) so first we need to pay attention to the uh counter trend trend correction that is happening in the market then as well we want it to be too like a pullback we want it to be a second entry and if you look at the situation right here now is the time to make it a little bit bigger if you look at the situation right here we have a first century short pullback second entry short now there is a little trendline working up higher but at this point on this is a tool like a pullback and if this was just a first entry this
(04:09) would not be ideal setup because we are inside of this trendline it's just the first entry but because it is a second entry because market likes to moves in twos to like a pullback and and it confirms the trend line the second entry is high probability setup in itself so that's the second way we find the high probability set up at the market we either wait for prices to have a break in a new high or we wait for a second entry and if we get both that's ideal this is just such a huge downtrend you know big gigantic move that it was
(04:39) very hard to fit second entry and break in a new high in one in you know in one this little counter trend and i will show you in much more detail example so these are the rules that we have to follow if you want to take safe entries um in in a downtrend because as you can see here the prices we have a setup here and even though it would have worked for a scalp that's not the point here hindsight is always 20 20 obviously but there's a there are times in the market when you will not get get the scout portion here and you will
(05:12) get stopped out and the reason is notice how we are now working higher in this two-tier channel working up higher and this is a bullish uptrend right now working higher so we need to first let this play out before we are going to take a short off of this trend line so hopefully you guys can see why this setup is not good and why these setups were much better these are the high probability setups and this is another high probability setup and this is why it barely worked and in a lot of instances it won't work at all as you
(05:42) guys can see we have a first break of this channel but we're continuing in this country trend of the overall trend down so this is our main focus right now and you guys can see how geometric a perfect market can be this is the first leg up you guys can see you can measure the leg first leg up two like a pullback second leg up to the very tick and there is a one leg right here correction second leg right here measured legs two measured legs perfect price action and there you know there is a there are level to this there's a two legged
(06:21) pullbacks inside of two legged pull backs two legged pull back right here and this can create one leg in bigger picture and two legged pull and this is the second leg so you guys can see that the two the market loves to moves in twos and second entry is extremely high probability setup if you find it at the key entry point if second entry is located at the key entry point which is the trend line and ema or support and resistance lines that's a very high probability setup and notice how overall even though we have this bullish
(06:54) correction broken up higher this bullish uptrend we have a break and a new high just like price action keeps telling us but remember the big players they're still in tension overall the longer term goal was to keep selling this market and we have the break we have a break this up trend breaking a new high and notice how prices manage to make a new low of this bigger channel working up lower so today is such a massive that you get two trends you get this trend inside of this trend but it all still you know plays out in the end we still
(07:31) have a new low right here prices make a massive lag to a new low of this downtrend working lower and from here you can see prices are beginning to reverse or go into correction that's what's going to happen after break and a new extreme prices will go into correction or possibly straight out reversal so these are the things to look for and now we are at the today's chart as i'm making this video and this is a you know because the trend lines they work on the bigger picture when you can see massive sell-off like you
(08:00) like i showed you earlier there was a massive downtrend hundred point move but it works the same way on the smaller on the smaller trend lines as well the price action is still worth the same way and if you learn to spot this you will have a gigantic edge in the market and the other question was what how do we react and what is our thought process when we see a break of a trend line so we have this trend line working about this is a short-term trend line that you would see when you first would come in and you first open up your chart so you
(08:28) guys can see per we we have small little consolidation right here this is really undecisiveness nobody knows what's going to happen and eventually prices broke higher and traders were starting to buy in and we have a first break of a trendline so what we are looking we are expecting a new extreme obviously after rule this is the rules of a trend line after a break of a trend line there's gold most likely going to be arrears of a new extreme but once again we are looking for highest probability setup as possible and the same thing when we
(08:58) were looking for bounces off the trend line this is what we are going to be looking as well so first thing first thing we need to do we need to let play out the kind of trend trend that is happening we are renowned wearing an uptrend and you can see this tiny little downtrend working lower we have a break and a new low this is exactly what we want to see we want to see all the bears and all their attempt to play out let them let them do their thing you know we don't let them do their thing we don't have to start buying early viciously and you
(09:31) will get stopped out here this is just the first break and this is the first entry and this is not high probability set up and this is why you would have failed and obviously you don't want to sell either just because you have a break of a trend line doesn't mean you want to automatically start to look for reversals because i see a lot of you know traders on youtube they teach you this then when you have a break of a trend line you should be automatically selling in this particular instance no that's not going
(09:57) to happen people want to see a retailers of a new extreme that just how human psychology works for some reason so we have a break and a new low we also have a two legged move one leg pullback second leg not quite measured enough because we are locating at the ema ema is another key entry point that is serving as a resistance or as a support so if you're a new trader to this channel and you're not using the ema this is a 21 bar ema and i would really recommend you to plot this because this is a really helpful indicator
(10:29) and it's just a supportive indicator but can be extremely helpful so we have a break in a new low and we're also looking for a second entry we have a new new high right here pullback first century long pullback it felt second entry long right here i mean excuse me it didn't fail right here because we are still part of the first entry so the second entry appeared here although you can make a case for second entry being this as well if you count it a little bit differently nevertheless here take a look how far away you are from ema
(11:02) and you know you already know probably my style i like to find the setups at the key entry point so when you're this far away from ema this is not a good setup to take so now you're locating at the ema and this is a two legged pullback so this is now the safe place to look for the prices to make a new high but there are going to be instances or before i'm gonna jump to the conclusion here we get another example working we have this downtrend working lower we have a first break of this channel big bullish bar and probably most people's first
(11:37) instinct would be to start buying this and this is wrong once again give the sellers a little bit more breathing room and they're going to read this of a new extreme after the bulls are trapped and we have a first century short pullback second entry short at the ema so this is a two legged pullback we also have a this uptrend working up higher we have a break and a new high so this the second rule and you guys can see price is made eventually new low just by one single take but there are going to be instances where
(12:11) you either are not going to make a break in a new high so meaning there's only going to be still the the uptrend in this instance is still be in play you will not get a break in a new high or sometimes you will not get too like a pullback it will be just the first entry and these are not high probability setups so what are we looking for in this instance all right so i found the perfect example because on today's chart we actually had a two like a pullback or second entries to make a new low and we ended up with what to do when we
(12:45) don't have a two legged pullback or a second entry so in this particular instance we are working up lower in this downtrend so we have a break of this trend right here once again so we have to draw the trend line and look we are working up higher and we see that we are still inside of this channel we are oops we have a first entry right here but we cannot take this this is not high probability setups even though we're looking for a new new low this is just the first entry so we cannot take this now we're still working up higher inside
(13:20) of this trend channel working up higher so we cannot take this as well there's a second reason why we cannot take this trade even though we are expecting for prices to make a new extreme so this is the third rule that we are applying when the first two rules the second entry or break in a new high are not being fulfilled and this is the we wait for two failed attempts in the counter trends direction meaning we will we wait for failed second entry long so we're working up higher this is the new high pullback first century long we triggered
(13:55) higher about this bar so this is the first entry long because you know the prices are most likely going to attempt to make a new high of this correctional empire so first century long you push through the ema so you guys you guys can see that a lot of people are starting to be selling the way we slice through ema pull back second entry along this is the second trigger long about this bar first trigger was here second trigger was here but this is way too low this move is way too low and you're way below ema and you're in and downtrend looking for
(14:24) a new low so this is the first century long second entry long so this would be a third rule that we apply this would be the perfect set up for us to be looking for a new low so hopefully you guys can see that if the first two rules are not being met the second entry long or a break and a new high we can be looking for a felt second entry long in this instance or felt second entry short if you're looking for you know uptrend uh to make a new high we we are here looking for downtrend to make a new high and we are looking for option we will be do
(15:01) doing the opposite and here we have a first century long second entry long that failed so this setup we can use this is a high probability set up as well and once again you guys can see market loves to moves in twos you know the second entry long fell and prices made a new low and we we eventually ended up going much lower and i'm not going to let you go this quickly because we still got a little bit more things to learn because you if you want to be successful trader you want to study the market every single day
(15:28) and watch the current market structure that is happening every single day because the patterns will repeat over and over again so you want to get as much screen time as you can so this was the today's price action and just as i came in we are broken up higher but this is still way too early this is pre-market open session the early morning session and we have this option working higher we have a break and a new high and price is made a second attempt to make a new high and then we trade it down lower so from this point
(15:57) on when i saw prices make this two i made this double top almost a triple top right here i was expecting for prices to reverse from here i still at this point i didn't have this resistance here because i only i drew this resistance once we bounce over here but at this point on i was looking at this as a first century long second entry long and i was looking for a reversal pattern and hoping to catch this exactly on this bar i was hoping for this bar to break lower and catch this move down to probably get to here to the very low of the day
(16:28) but it didn't happen we bounced off here and now we have a triple bottom right here very clear triple bottom and it's starting to look quite rangy straight off the bed at the very beginning of the day so this is the new low we push above the ema and we have a first century long pullback second entry long right here this is the bullish bar we triggered higher above this bar i mean first century short second entry short i probably said a second entry long excuse me first century short pull back second entry short we are about the ema ema is holding
(17:01) prices each time and the fact as i was here looking for the failure and reversal pattern and it didn't happen uh and prices pushed through the ema i had to switch the gears here and this is why you trade the market you get and not the market you want because i i wanted to set up the reversal pattern setup and you know the institutions they had other plans they were actually looking for take these prices higher so what i would do you know i said okay this is what you guys want to do and i'm just going to follow you
(17:33) so first century short second entry short high probability setup we are still above the ema ema is holding prices and you got still quite some room before you reach these highs and lord behold it worked for a scalp and now you don't want to go along here even though ema is holding prices here you're going along exactly into this resistance and this is a sure way to get trapped so just let the prices do their thing and they push higher they pull back you have a new high right here you have a first century long pull back pullback you're working up
(18:06) lower lower and you're expecting some second entry long failure you're hoping for second entry long fare failure maybe prices stick one tick above here and then give you a reversal pattern because we already we definitely have a break and a new high right here definitely break and a new high and we broke about this resistance and most breakouts will fail but this was quite still early for me to fade this because this is quite still a little bit bullish so so i wasn't too sure about fading this but remember most breakouts
(18:37) will fail 90 of breakouts of trading ranges will fail so we have a first century long you're working up lower and like i said you're hoping to get some second entry loan failure but it didn't happen you get a second entry long failure all the way down here way too late far away from ema too close to this too close to the support so even though this is a break and you're waiting for a new low this is a felt second entry long you're going along all the way late of this move this move has already happened and you're going
(19:07) late you're going short very late so you obviously have to skip this and now you have this like we mentioned first entry short second entry short break add a new height at the ema but you're very close to this support to this support we have a triple bottom right here quadruple bottom confirmed right here so only when you want to take this you want to place your limit order further back that way you can get safely out you can put your target profit at this support so this is the safest way because other than that you probably
(19:40) would have failed and there's a reason why you're where this scalp would have failed because the strong support is holding prices at this point on you know it's very clear and a lot of traders can spot this because this is a quadruple bottom at this point on and this is very easy to see so we have a break and a new low and look at this gigantic bar we are bouncing off the support and this is looking like a trading right now definitely so when we are coming off the lows you're probably expecting for prices to reach you know the highest the
(20:08) resistance just you would be expecting so big bullish bar sliced through the ema like it's not even there we completely ignored the ema first century short pullback second entry short nice big bullish reversal bar but you're going long at the very high of the move and i already mentioned this in my previous videos i like to take the reverser patterns that are a little bit closer to the ema a little bit deeper the pullback is a little bit deeper you're going along you know quite late here and at the very high and this is exactly what's going to
(20:39) happen you almost 90 percent of the time you're gonna get this get a little bit of a pullback i mean it still would have worked but you guys can see the body is far away from ema but here you're a little bit closer to ema with the body and it's still part of this second entry short failure so this is the safer entry and we're you're still above the ema you're still expecting for prices to reach this high and notice this was a spike this was a very big bar this was a very big spike and prices just kept going inside of
(21:07) this channel so this is why i found this this is a spike and a channel because this was a very steep move up you have a break and a new high perfect price action you're working up low lower you have a selloff here and this setup even though it may sound counterintuitive for a lot of you this is a very safe setup because 90 of breakouts of trading ranges will fail and now you have quadruple i mean quintuple bottom if that's even a word uh you have a fifth bounce here of the support you are clearly in a trading range
(21:41) and look how far away you are from ema and this is a first first breakout to the low side you know most likely you're going to snap back so even though this is looking like you know you're picking bottom here you're not really picking bottom here that much this is a failed breakout lower and the support is proven a lot so this is a little bit of a aggressive but it is not that aggressive as you might think so learn to trust these failed breakouts you guys can see you're working up higher and i was expecting some sort of
(22:14) reversal pattern here but you know sellers came in and you instantly closed below ema first century short second entry short but you that the bullish bar closed below ema so you don't want to take this this you know the the reversal pattern is just like here when prices are holding above the ema and then the second entry long once first century long second entry long and once again you're below the ema so there was a little bit of dilemma for me here where i was trying to go long but you're still being below ema
(22:47) so i wasn't really trusting these setups i mean it worked but you know you're below ema and you can make a case for the support being here obviously but by the time this setup uh this bar setup and this bar now you're just going up and down up and down the ema is middle inside of this bar this is a smaller trading range and i think the best way is to skip this if there was a little bit better setup you can take along here but you know i don't think may just be my personality but you know this is looking too congested for me but
(23:20) you're coming off this strong support once again double tests over here so obviously you can take a chance here and go long you have this trend line working up higher once again draw these trend lines you will have such an advantage over other traders it's ridiculous you have a break few likes to a new high you're working up lower and you have a break and a new low and you have a one more push higher and i was obvious honestly i was expecting for prices to continue working up higher but we made this double top right here
(23:50) and we have a first century long pullback second entry long price is closed below ema this is a good sign here so i wasn't you know on the board of shorting this market because we already have a break at a new low but we continue working up lower and prices kept closing below ema and with these two felt attempts higher and a nice bearish reversal bar inside of the ema you know that a lot of lungs got trapped they're going long below ema when the brake at a new high already happened so a lot of lungs got trapped here so i
(24:25) think this is worthwhile short taking this even though it's not ideal because you have you already have a break and you low and you just made a few more legs to a new low and you have a first century short you push above the ema so once again second entry short prices are ema is holding prices second entry short failure big bullish reversal bar this is a reversal pattern and i mean this reversal pattern is absolutely perfect it's off to trendline off the ema you're hugging ema nicely felt second entry is short because you
(25:00) have this is the second two felt attempts in the previous direction which was the downtrend but the dungeon already played out so it's safe for us to go long and you're working up higher you have a tiny little break and a new high so you would be expecting for prices to make now to reverse or goes in some sort of a correction so we have a first century long pullback second entry long oh wow and it worked here so at this point on you should be expecting for prices to reverse you have a tiny little break and a new high
(25:30) so you should be expecting for prices to go lower now to start selling off but it didn't happen so you have to start paying a little bit more attention here because okay for century long second inch long you're expecting failure and going lower and it didn't happen wow okay so you have this big bearish bar certainly now you know sellers they will go long they will go short i mean if this break is not clear enough then this break is close enough to being as attempt to make a new high so this gigantic bearish bar surely set
(26:01) us well so of the market now and once again big bullish bar and once again we close above the ema so once again wow this is a little bit you know i wasn't expecting this because the sellers are not shorting the market and you have a this is the new low right here first century short second entry short this is a second entry shortly triggered and this is where it fell on this big bullish reversal bar it's above the ema ema is holding prices and just like you were your thought process that was happening previously
(26:33) you were expecting for prices to keep going lower and it didn't and they actually trapped here the sellers got trapped here two felt attempts to go lower nice bar above the ema you guys can see we actually made a new high perfect price action and prices you know took a huge dump here three massive bars so you know that you know the sellers are now looking to show this market they just gave the bulls a little bit more room three massive bar slower new low right here first century short pull back second entry short you're
(27:07) you're quite far away from ema but this is just a strong move down three massive moves down it is a second entry if this was just the first entry i i wouldn't take this trade but since it is a second entry short and a nice bearish bar i think it's worth taking this trade and you have a break and a new low and the prices as i'm making the video prices are doing their thing so hopefully you guys i'm going to wrap it up so hopefully you guys get a little bit more uh you're a little bit more sure what to how to react when you see a break of a
(27:40) trend line and how to find the highest probability setups while looking for a new extreme and how to find high probability setups at the trend lines so i'm going to wrap it up if you enjoyed the video hit the like button and i'm going to see you guys in the next one bye guys

(00:00) what's going on traders in this video we're going to take a closer look at inside bars we're going to talk about what are inside bars how to trade them correctly and when to avoid trading them and at the end of the video i'm going to show you guys why i personally like trading inside bars and how can they save us some money so what exactly is an inside bar well just like the picture depicts inside bar is just the bar that it's closes of highs and lows are still contained by the previous bar and that means even for tails so not
(00:32) just the body even tails or the wicks are still inside of the previous but of the previous scandal highs and lows but to be honest with you inside bars is quite rare phenomenon you won't really see a lot of inside bars during your trading session but it is still important to take a closer look how to trade them correctly here we are at the chart and the first inside bar that i just saw right of the get-go is this bearish bar you guys can see that the highs of the previous bar are marked right here the lows of the
(01:06) previous bar are marked right here and the candle is still in the middle of this bar the bar didn't close higher or lower it is still contained by the previous bar here we have another example of inside bar this is just tiny little bullish bar you guys can see the highs and the lows of the previous bar and the inside bars close still in the middle of that bar we didn't close higher or below so this bar this is what you would call an inside bar now before we dive into talking about inside bars i really want to emphasize
(01:39) that the market context and market structure is everything trading the candlesticks alone that's not the way to do it trying to analyze and identify the current market context and what the market structure is looking like that is this trading skill that every trader is trying to acquire so don't just think that learning about candlestick patterns will make you a successful trader trying to identify the current and the best context the trying to identify the market structure that's the way to go of course we as a
(02:10) traders we are looking for good signal bars to confirm our analysis that we are reading the price action well and if the signal bar is not good we're not taking the trade but that mean that doesn't mean we're just looking at the signal bars market context is everything and finding the high probability setup at key entry points is the way to go there are some traders who don't like trading inside bars and there are some traders who like trading inside bars who have strategies how to trade inside bars but we really don't have the option to
(02:42) avoid trading inside bars to be honest with you because we're trying to find the highest probability setups at the key entry points and just as you see on the chart the three bars that i mount here all of these bars are inside bar this bullish bar right here is inside bar to this previous bearish bar this bullish bar right here is an inside bar to the previous parish bar and this bullish bar right here is an inside bar once again to the previous bearish bar all of these bars are confirming the trend line they are in an uptrend there is a
(03:16) congruent support running here and it is a second entry long right here you have a br trend line working over you have a break and a new low so identifying the context is everything according to our price action rules and we cannot really avoid trading inside bar so in this particular instance whether we like it or not we just have to take the trade even if we are against trading inside bar because the setup is so good and it's such a high probability that it's going to work because it is at the key entry point and
(03:44) all other factors of our strategy played out we cannot really avoid taking these trades now we're going to dive into the part when i'm going to show you guys why are inside bars beneficial and why i really like inside bars so just like you can see on the chart we are in an uptrend bullish uptrend you guys can see you can find the trend line fairly easily it fits nicely we have this new highway working out right here we have a downtrend working lower we have a break and a new low so according to price action rules this downtrend has played
(04:16) out and this correction is over after this correction is over we can be safely looking for longs so the first long entry that could have happened was bouncing off this trend line but you guys can see we didn't trigger above this bullish bar so that means the bullish entry didn't trigger yet we cannot go along yet and you guys can see the third bar this is the bar that i marked is an inside bar of this bearish bar and thus of this bullish bar and the reason why i like the inside bars because they allow us to enter a little bit further back
(04:49) and to enter much safely and we are risking less money because with this bullish bar being established all we have to do is wait for one tick trigger higher above this bar and we can drop our order in and take the trade we no longer have to wait let me make it a little bit bigger so you guys can see because this is just by one single take and i got more examples prepared for you guys you guys can see that in this particular instance we saved one tick of our entry because we only waited for trigger higher above this bar if we
(05:20) waited for trigger higher above this bar we already would have been one tick further behind so this in this instance signal bar helped us and saved us one more take at least in this instance the market context is we are in a bearish downtrend you guys can see the market is making lower highs lower lows we get the trend line in play because we want to successfully and then identify the trend prices may be low right here we're working up higher we have this bullish correction working on higher why this isn't why this is correction because we are
(05:52) still in a downtrend and we have this correction working up higher we have a break and a few legs to a new high so from this point on this bullish correction played out and we can be safely looking for trades to resume the downtrend and now you guys can see we have a lower high right here this bearish bar created a lower high of this this high right here this high is lower than this high so i'm waiting for trigger below this bar so i can go short here but here take a look i have an inside bar here i actually have a
(06:23) double inside bar right here the first bar right here is an inside bar the body and the wicks are still contained by the previous bar highs and lows so this is an inside bar so i am waiting for one tick trigger below this bar and i don't have to wait for one take trigger below this bar and it actually happened the better instance we have this tiny little bar that save us one more tick now in this instance when we have a two inside bars of this bar of this this would be the initial entry that we liked taking our trades on
(06:55) but we just have to wait for one tick trigger below this bar to to take the trade whoops to take the trade and notice how much ticks you would have said you would have saved three ticks right here because this is still the part of the lower high so our analysis was done on this bar but we we didn't get the trigger below this bar one take we didn't get the trigger below this bar one take we got the trigger one tick below this bar so we saved quite some quite some money because our stop loss in case the trade would have failed was
(07:30) much smaller than the previous entry bar right here and here i've prepared for you some more examples of inside bars you guys can see we have this downtrend working lower we have this bullish correction working up higher we have a break and a new high this bearish bar is an inside bar of this previous previous bullish bar so if we are following our rules we cannot really avoid taking this trade this is a very high probability trade because we are waiting for a break and a new low of this downtrend right here and this bearish and this bullish
(08:01) correction played out so this is the one example of an inside bar here we have inside bar once again we have this downtrend working lower we have a break and we are waiting for a new low but first we need to let this bullish correction play out we have a break and a new high and it is a second entry short of the ema and take a look this bearish bar right here is an inside bar to this bullish bar and take a look how we with with us entering here because if we didn't enter here and we waited for bar to finish lower to you know
(08:36) close below this bullish bar so it's not an inside bar we would have been risking much more ticks the signa bar right here that we entered the entry bar allow us to save us few ticks just like here we have uptrend working up higher we have a break and a new high this bearish bar is an inside bar to this bullish bar and notice how we close in the middle of this bullish bar we don't have to wait for prices to close below this in this previous bullish bar so this allows us to save a lot more ticks to enter in the middle
(09:09) and thus our stop loss is much smaller and i managed to find one more example where the entering on inside bar is not to wait to do it and this is exactly how not to take the inside bar trade because as i told you guys the market context is everything but here we have an instance because in the previous examples every time we entered inside bar the inside bar was actually or had a little resemblance to the body in the direction we were taking the trade so if we were taking the bearish trade the inside bar had a bearish body
(09:45) and if we were taking the bullish trade we were buying the market the inside bar was bullish here we have a bullish option working up higher we have a new height right here we have a first century long pullback second entry long now we want to trigger we we won't trigger one tick higher above this bullish bar for our second entry long to trigger to go long here but the next bar was inside the bar was this bearish inside bar if this bearish inside bar looked for example like this bullish doji this would have been a good trade to
(10:18) enter one tick above this inside bar and we would have saved few ticks but since we are in an uptrend we're looking to buy and thus we need the signal bars to be bullish this inside bar is heavily buried this is a bearish bar so entering on this inside bar would not be smart and this is how not to enter inside bar how to avoid trading inside bar in this particular instance the correct way would be to wait for break above this bar and you know potentially drop your limit order further back if you don't want to risk
(10:49) a lot of money but you know i really couldn't find a lot of examples of this on the chart and i looked through you know through a lot of days so this is very rare the inside bar is most likely going to be good in our direction but just to show you guys you know that there are some instances that where you don't want to take the trade and it is where the inside bar when the inside bar is really in the opposite direction that we are taking the trade but the biggest takeaway from this video i want you guys to understand that really the market
(11:23) context is everything and the candlestick patterns the signal bars they're just you know a little tool that we use to help us you know filter the good or bad trade but you cannot trade on candlesticks alone you cannot because it is easy to make a bunch of videos about pin bars you know inside bars outside bars you know harami origami whatever the you know japanese names for this is but the overall the core of traders skill skill set is learning to identify the market context is learning to find a key entry point and file
(11:59) and find the high probability setups because you could be taking you know the pin bars reversal bar the inside box all over the chart and you would have been losing a lot of money because that's not the way to do it so this is just a little tool that traders use to you know confirm the confirm the analysis but overall we cannot really avoid trading inside bars so don't really sweat it too much don't really focus that much on inside bars because when we are at the key entry point it is a second entry long or we have a multiple key levels right
(12:32) here that are running congruently and the previous correction played out that's the most important thing




(270) Understanding MEASURED MOVES and Two-Legged Pullback In Price Action Trading - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHaDDLX9lOc

Transcript:
(00:00) market geometry is a real thing and together with price action they are interrelated and not just two separate entities understanding market geometry can help trader understand price action and can help trader to predict where the moves are most likely going to happen because overall market loves two moves in twos and you guys can see i've proven this many times market overall likes two moves in twos there's a thing called two-legged pullback and it works it is tied to human psychology and we can use a tool that is called a
(00:34) measured move and measurement basically relies on predicting the second lag that is most likely going to follow because market just is not moving in just this one moves up down up down you guys can see that the market has corrections and what the measured moves relies on is you're going to measure the first lag of the price action that is occurring so at this point on this is a downtrend and we have a first leg working lower and you have a break of a trend line and you know according to price action rules that the sellers are going to be looking
(01:08) for a new low and you may be wondering if you're holding a runner or some sort of swing position where is the move most likely going to go so this is how we can use the measured moves you guys can see this is the first leg this is the second leg it wasn't quite measured but it goes deeper than that because there are two legged moves inside a two legged moves so this would be on the slightly bigger picture a bigger leg one leg and this would be the second leg so you guys can see one leg pull back second leg here we have a
(01:43) leg working up higher one leg correction second move up and inside this two-legged move up there is two like a move down this one is not measured at all but market moves in tools market creates two like a pullbacks here we have a move working up higher we have a break of a trend line so we are expecting a new high and we have a move up but as you guys saw on the previous example this two legged move up one leg second leg up that is slightly more choppy this was one leg and it creates the second lag with this bigger lag so measured moves can be used
(02:28) to help you navigate the markets and where you should be keeping your runners they are not a single tool that you should be using alone this is just a helpful tool that you can have in your toolbox while you're trying to read the price action just look at the measured moves and here's a another example here's a one leg down pull back second leg down break new low market laps two moves in twos and there are two legged moves on lower uh time frames as well on smaller picture first century long second entry long this is a two legged move
(03:02) first century long second inch long two legged moves so overall we are looking for the two like a pullbacks for the second entries at the high probability setup and as the market today started the price action started with this downtrend we have a break and a new law so you have to draw the short term trend lines to help you analyze the chart because you know the rules of the trend line after break there's going to be roots of a new extreme and with the new low you are expecting a possible correction or straight up reversal you guys can see
(03:31) the prices were working up higher prices are inside of this channel that fits prices nicely we have an overshoot with most likely going to leak to a break of the little break of the channel this happened two-legged move and a new high so this bullish correction is over but at the same time this very downtrend was over so price action right here was really the consolidation and it was fairly hard to read what is going to happen most you guys can see there's a double top form and triple top right here there are multiple bottoms right here
(04:02) but i did the mistake of not drawing the clear key levels this is what you should have drawn right here with this double top right here you felt break higher and you have multiple bottoms right here but i didn't draw it at the time i just was relying solely on these trend lines and it was my mistake i got too comfortable nevertheless you have this new high first century long pull back second entry long so you know but we are now we are shooting through the ema so you know this uptrend is over and there are no polls left in the market
(04:32) because we are shooting through ema we pull back the ema this is just the first entry and market moves into so first entry is not really reliable and you make a second entry long trap but look how far away you're from ema so even though this is a second entry long and we are in a downtrend currently we are so far away from key entry point that market is most likely going to snap soon and it made that one little push down lower before it railed up higher but this is not high probably set up so i cannot market because it's not according to our
(04:59) rules and prices reverse and they push through the ema and unfortunately here we have a first century short and market i was hoping for market to give me a failed second entry short at the ema this would be brilliant but it didn't happen market went out without me and second entry short happened this far away from ema at the very height of the move and you know how how i feel the reversal pattern you already missed the reversa pattern it basically didn't happen it needs to be at the ema and it needs to be much closer this is
(05:28) already way too late but i entered this was my first trade and i only took two trades today i took this one and i took this one and this is the new high first century long pull back second entry long and once again if we measure the legs this is the first leg working lower you have a bullish bar so the this is a correction and this and the second and the second measured leg down so two legged move two at the ema and what i did because this is a burst bar and you cannot enter above this bearish bar and this blush
(06:02) bar is way too big so i drop my limit order exactly to the end of this bar to this level so i got filled on this bar made the scalp of course they came back and got the runner unfortunately but now you have a break and a new high and even though you have a new law right here first century short second entry short nice bullish bar of the ema you already have a new high and you don't know if it's going to keep working up higher at this point or this is what you would see and it's not really clear whether you're gonna go higher or not
(06:32) so this is the safer entry second entry long high probability setup we're waiting we have a break and we wait for a new high and we have a break in a new low of this short term downtrend and price is made in new high you guys can see double top right here so with prices making a new high you're expecting a correction or possible reversal that the bulls are be weakened at least for a short period of time your first century long you push through ema beautiful big bearish bars second entry along closing below ema look how ema is
(07:03) rejecting the prices is not letting prices close above the ema only below ema beautiful bearish reversal bar i dropped my limit order there is a gap i didn't get filled prices didn't even take one tick back they just quickly filled the scalp portion of those people who use stops so i missed this trade and i drew the shortened trend line once again you have a break and you low so you're just using these trend lines and you're just following the price action hoping that the rules are going to pay because nine out of 10 times
(07:35) they are going to work you have a break new low you have a first entry short you push through ema second entry shot and you close above the ema the reason why i didn't take this trade live because i didn't have my key levels drawn on the chart and this was my cardinal sin today big mistake by me i was trying to play play too cool but you always have to draw these because trading will become so much simpler how easy it is to find this quadruple bottom and triple top right here and it also gives validity to this trade i
(08:11) didn't even notice this real time now you get two key entry points you have a felt brake lower support is holding second attempt support is holding big bullish bar and we are pushing through the ema what i like better is drawing this trend line and have a first century long pullback second and too long off the key entry point to like a pullback according to our rules and prices worked higher you have a breakout higher it failed there is a pullback and this is going to be known as a breakout pullback i normally don't
(08:46) mark breakout pullbacks because they are not reliable only reason you want to mark breakout pullback is when they are at the good key entry point and is the second entry just like here first century long second entry long you have a trend line you have ema and you have this resistance that now acts as a support this is a valid breakout pullback trade if there was on this trend line or the ema there was just this resistance that now acts as a support this would be very iffy trade it will be like 50 50 but with the key entry point
(09:17) together here this can be very 80 or 90 probability trade and is the second entry long and but the signal bar is not ideal so i would definitely use the limit order here but you know to close up the measured moves can be very helpful and don't rely on simple on just measured moves they're just a tool to you know help you a little bit to predict where the market is most likely going to go and just like we have a two legged move here together it created this one leg pull back second leg down so there are two legged
(09:51) moves inside of two legged moves and marker geometry is very real you guys can see that the second entry longs are very violet and felt second entry longs if you're looking for the trend reversal trend change entries because we have a break at a new high so these were the trades for the day don't forget to use those measured moves and market geometry with price action are definitely real and very reliable tools for your trading so i'm gonna wrap it up and i'm going to see you guys in the next one bye guys

Transcript:
(00:00) so i would say at least six or seven out of ten times mark is going to be in some form of trading range the strong uptrends or strong downtrends these are rare phenomenons because trading would be easy like that we all want that but most of these days are going to be very slow choppy methodical trading ranges just they're you know hard to trade and it's hard to find the good setups so in this video i'm going to show you guys how to make trading as simple as possible and how to find the highest probability setups during these type of
(00:28) days so first thing i want to mention is that the price action is universal our rules work on all markets on all time frames so if you learn to read the price action you will use these skills and you will translate it into multiple different markets and by the way if you're new to this channel my name is thomas wade i'm a price action day trader so that means i solely rely on the candles i don't need no fancy indicators so i'm using for explanation to this video this is s p 500 2000 tick chart there is however one indicator that i'm
(00:58) going to be using this is 21 bar ema 21 bar ema is this blue line that is going up and down up and down this is just a supportive indicator that i use to help me identify you know what the current market structure is looking like and sometimes the ema may serve as a key entry point because key entry points are the points where highest probability setups occur and those are support and resistance lines and trend lines and plus ema but also i can use the ema during the slow trading range like this you know just to see what are the up
(01:33) trends what are the down trends and you guys can see that the ema is really flat most of the times this is just this was just a short little uptrend but you know then ema went flat once again so there's a no clear up trend and no clear downtrend by the way if you're asking yourself how do you exactly recognize the trading range you know what if there's some sort of uptrend basically this is the no brainer question you if you're in a trend uptrend or downtrend you already know you don't have to ask yourself you know it's the situation where you're
(02:03) not sure what's going to happen you really cannot find the best setups that is the some form of trading range trading range doesn't have to have perfect you know support and resistance double taps double bottoms but there is some variation of it so the second thing i have to do if i want to trade this trading range successfully i need to identify the support and resistance lines because training edge is always you know binded by these lines so i have to find the key levels that was we call it and i came around when i came around to
(02:36) the chart somewhere around this point so all i would see would be this price action that is right here so i can tell just by eyeballing there is some double tap form happening so i'm gonna put my resist resistance line at the top like this at the same time i can see there is some form of support happening right here this is a key level and prices are reacting nicely to it so these these are my you know this is the first thing my pre-market analysis that i have to do if i want to you know find the best setups as possible
(03:11) and what are the best setups as possible as i keep mentioning over and over again well basically these are two legged moves you know price action trader probably very famous you all know him al brooks you know he figured out that the market moves in twos and there are two legged pullbacks two legged entries all over the chart it's just tied down to our human psychology you don't have to you know go deep why it works you just have to understand that there market moves in twos make two like a pullbacks and the second entries
(03:40) are high probability setups if you find them on the right places and also you know when we are looking for can trend trend entries we are looking for failed second entries so but we cannot just find this entry we cannot just take these entries all over the chart because you know some of these entries will fail on the more you probably can have like 65 win percentage if you just trade those second entries or the traps alone but you know my goal is to have as less losers as possible you know but everybody has losers you know i'm no
(04:13) trading guru i'm just a guy i'm just a trader but you know who has losses as well but my goal is to have as less losses as possible so what i'm going to use during this trading range i'm going to use the shortened trend lines because there's a rule in price action regarding trend lines that after trendline breaks the traders are going to look most likely for the retailers of a new extreme and after the new extreme is being retested there there may possibly be correction or straight up reversal and this information is you know crucial
(04:47) to me where while i'm you know trying to identify what's going on in the markets so the first trendline i would draw would be trendline something like this i'm gonna make it slightly lighter opacity so this would be the downtrend working lower and you guys can see we have a break and a new low prices went into smaller consolidation smaller congestion this is still you know pre-market open so no wonder market is you know slow volatility like this and we have a second leg to a new low we have broken lower first lag
(05:19) two new low pullback second leg to a new low so from this point on i was expecting you know move up because this downtrend played out so i was expecting to move up so your first instinct what can you do is you can draw the very shortened trend line something like this and you have a break and a new high you have another break and another new high and you guys can see that you know this is probably very very short in trend line you know this is probably not valid because you guys can see there's some pattern forming
(05:48) and you keep making higher highs higher highs so there are some probably some bigger trend lines so what i did i adjusted the trend line like this and you guys can see how nicely it fits off the top this is the tip for you guys you don't have to find it always off the bottoms sometimes and if you learn to spot it off the top you will get and you know edge because you will have your trend line much quicker in place if you find it off the top right here and you put it to the bottom like here you can actually take this trade very
(06:16) early and you're you know much ahead of a lot of you know price action traders who are relying to wait to market prove them what is going to happen and you have a break and a new high or attempt excuse me attempt to make a new high and here would be our first high probability setup because this is the new high that price is made and we're working up lower we have a first century long because prices trigger one tick higher above this bar and the first century long failed but that's okay because we don't want to
(06:45) take first century long even though it's off to trend line this is very small trend line but the high probability setups as i mentioned earlier in the video is the second entry long in this particular instance you know the long are the second entries so first century long they failed pull back second entry long so this is a tool like a pullback but also there is another you know key information that we are looking for we have a first break of this channel working up higher and we are in the trading range and in trading range you go from lows to
(07:12) the highest and vice versa so we are looking for a new high of this uptrend and we're also looking for prices to reach the resistance you know it was good enough for scalp because this is what we do here we're mainly scalpers you know quick easy trade and market you know gave up and made a one push lower you know so attempt to make a new high is close enough sometimes in price action you you're gonna have a perfect new low just like here and sometimes there's just gonna be attempt to make a new high nothing is
(07:40) ever you know 100 in price action if it was like that trading would be easy and we all would be super crazy rich so as the trading as the market is reversing or what i can do as well is to draw the trend line just take into consideration this move and draw the trend line something like this and now we have a treadmill working lower we have a break and a new low at this point on we are bouncing off the resistance and you guys can see me bounce off the resistance here of the support excuse me which would be a potential
(08:14) long setup but you know as you know we have a break and a new low here so from this point on market played out this downtrend is over and this is a failed break below this support now you know i know that most people on youtube teach to buy or sell the breakouts but most breakouts of trading ranges will fail at least temporary you almost always going to get some sort of pullback back into the support or resistance line retest it and then continue working up higher eventually the breakouts will go and break in that direction yes but most of these
(08:52) breakouts will fail so this trade right here this is a failed break below this support right here it is a fail break below this double bottom right here and this is the way we want to capitalize on it because a lot of traders a lot of institutions know that all the people who are going long about this support they're keeping their you know they're keeping their sell stops probably a few ticks below these bars so what they're do they're willing to push the market lower just a little bit trap all these traders out use their
(09:25) liquidity and then rally the market higher in their position because they they don't want to keep just buying the market because they will be making their prices incrementally lower and lower they would be you know losing money so to say so they want to use the liquidity of everybody who went along right here because the people use their stops few ticks below these important lows and i'm going to do the same thing as the pro market is working up higher i'm going to draw the shortened trend line to you know help me identify
(09:55) what kind of trend it is so i can look for a break and i can look for high probability setups so here in this instance we have uptrend working up higher we push through the ema nicely and this is what i like to see i like want to see the no rejection from the ema there are no there are very few traders trying to go short at the ema we've sliced through ema we have a strong leg up we have a first century long pull back second entry long this is a high probability set up second entry long this is the first break of this trend
(10:24) line and we wait for a new high just like we waited here but we are already by the time this bar finishes we're already very close to the resistance very close to the high of the previous move and this bar is way too big and we are quite far away from ema just a little bit i would like for prices to touch ema a little bit better so this is a two legged pullback still would have worked this is why the high priority setups you know they work so often but you know we want to you know minimize you know our losses as possible and you
(10:53) know you never know whether this is going to take a few ticks ups and then instantly reverse lower so we keep working up higher right here your first leg to a new high pull back attempt to make a second lag take a look we broke clearly this resistance and you know just like always what's most likely going to happen you're going to have a felt breakout at least price is going to try to go and retest the support that may act as a go re-test this the resistance excuse me that may act as a support now since this is a fail break higher
(11:26) there could be a case made for traders taking the shorts right here the shorts right here the shorts right here all of these shorts would have worked because you would be keeping your stops above the signal bars so all these trades would have worked but that's not the point here for my liking these traits are still a little bit too aggressive even though this is a failed breakout and you're very far away from ema like here an ema acts as a magnet it will pull prices together this is also another reason why i like plotting the
(11:55) ema because the further further you are away from ema there there's a bigger likelihood you're going to snap back and pull back so this was you know felt break higher above this resistance possibility another good trade but what i like to do we have this you know small little triple taps here some sort of variation when i'm looking for counter trend trend entries you know i'm looking for second entries to fail when i'm going long in trend i'm looking for second entries long but right now this uptrend played out and i'm looking for shorts because i'm
(12:30) relying on the breakout failing and i'm relying on very long people who bought the market you know going to be late to the party so i'm looking for failures of second entries so i i started a count over this from this bar because all these highs are matching we have a first attempt to go higher that failed and a second attempt to go higher and this is a nice rejection bearish bar now this is a two legged pullback long but why am i not taking this to like a pullback long but it is a second entry long so why why am
(13:04) i not taking this well it's because the option already played out and this is a trading range you know if if this was a very strong uptrend i could potentially be looking to take you know additional second entries even if the trend played out but this is a clear trading range and you're just late to the party going long right here so this is a first entry long pullback second entry long that failed it is a fail break higher and you know felt second entry long and since we are working lower i can draw i can either draw the shortened
(13:36) trend line like this but this feels like it's a little bit too far away from this downtrend so what i would do i would draw the downtrend like this and just copy it and put it to the other side you can use the tool i just like you to do it the old-fashioned way so this is a two felt attempts working up higher and quick easy scalp high probability setups all just using the shoulder tune simple simple price action i'm just using the shorter trendlines and relying on trendline on trending range rules working but as you guys can see we pushed higher
(14:11) and there was unexpected you know buying power a lot of people starting to buying you know out of the nowhere but you know there is no way to know you know to buy this market or to sell this market you just you just took your high priority setup right here and you watch the prices go and you you just made one big leg up it's still you know we're above the resistance so no surprise prices pull back lower but here you know you can see that the price action started to change a little bit because we were supposed to go lower if
(14:41) this is a proper trading range you're supposed to go up down up down we were supposed to go down here so the way we pushed higher above this this is the new high right here you have a first century long pullback second entry long attempt and this is the new low your first century short pullback second entry short attempt now you can see how this bullish bar is now relying on you know the support the previously acted as a resistance you know the difference between this bar and the bar right here this you know this was just a trap to
(15:19) trap people who went along way too late because the current uptrend played out but now we start to get more price action so we have to adapt because clearly we're not working out lower and what you can see there's some potential trend line bigger trend line that can be working like this and when you're trading live this is all you would see this is all you would see so this would look very legit you have a new law right here first century short second entry short first century long second entry long bullish bar we're coming off the trend
(15:51) line and we're coming off the that previously acted as resistance so you adapt your gears your switch the gears just a little bit because you don't want to keep forcing selling the market when it's giving you clear signs that it's not you know going to the other side because we were supposed to rally lower just off of this downtrend and it didn't happen and you and you guys can see we have a break attempt to make a new la new low but there's a trend line in play so this is close enough it's just attempt for me to make a new low and i'm fine with
(16:25) this and i felt second entry short nice bullish bar quick for a scalp and prices are starting to make a huge taps here for you know this is where the price actions start to be a little bit unclear so are we going higher or are we going lower because once again you have a double tap right here and you snap back instantly lower you have a first century long second entry long failure pull back off the ema and of the resistance now but when you're trading this live this is all you see so you're still expecting uptrend but once you keep
(16:58) working lower you push below ema and the ema holds prices this is where you have to once again adapt this is why trading takes you know quite some time to learn because you have to learn how to adapt and how to learn to read the price action because as we are working lower right here we are so below ema now we this move was gigantic below ema this move was slow choppy there was a lot of bullish bars there was a multiple bearish consecutive bars so this is a clear sign that the trend is changing you push below ema beautiful bearish
(17:31) reversal bar and the ema holds prices nicely this is a sign that there's a lot of sellers in the market you know selling at the ema so this is a good indication but it's just a first entry even though we have a break of this channel we're waiting for a new low according to trendline rules this is the first entry what i like to wait is for this lower high another confirmation of the ema gigantic bearish bar and it is a form of you know two attempts to go lower so this is another high probability setup we are still below the ema
(18:04) and we are still waiting for a new low of this dumpster because we broke the trend line so most likely we're going to retest the new extreme and we're close very close to coming re-tested re-testing this support and the price action is starting to reverse




(270) How To Use Market Close To PREDICT GOOD Trades (OHL Indicator) - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ajq4FELRa1s

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video we're going to talk about how we can use the market close to predict or trying to predict the higher probability setups because the general consensus is that the trader should not be trading like an hour or two hour before the close and that is a good rule i recommend traders not to be trading like the two hours before the close at least because a lot of traders are just trying to get rid of these orders volatility is slowing down tremendously and traders just want to get rid of all their contracts because they don't want
(00:27) to hold the market overnight and hope uh that you know mark is going to go in their favor because it may go in the opposite direction but just because the market closed that doesn't mean that we cannot use this piece of information to our advantage so here you can see the vertical line for those of you guys who are not familiar with this ninjatrader software you use something else this is the vertical line that separates the trading session this is the today's trading session this was the yesterday trading session this was the market
(00:54) close you guys can see that the market close can serve for us trying to find the key level and you guys can see it came into play with this nice bounce and i normally don't talk about this and i completely forgot to mention this so i decided to make a video about how important is to pay attention to market closes because they can serve as the key levels that will you know try to give you the higher probability setups and it's not important why it works we don't care why it works like this we are price action day
(01:25) traders we don't care about the fundamentals we just are technical analysis traders and we just are interested that it works so as long as it works that is fine with us and but you don't have to eyeball the market close and the key levels just you know using your eye there's actually an indicator that you can plot it is called i forgot what it's called it's like current high or low let me find this one more time there it is current day high and low and you can apply it and the close would be actually you can see that the bar close
(02:04) slightly here i had a slightly higher but that you know few ticks it's not important you can see this yellow line or this or this orange-ish line this is what you know signifies the market close and if this seems a little bit too cluttered because this indicator shows you the highs of the day and the lows of the day and the market open but if you just want to use the clothes for the day because that is the most important you don't need to know what is the high of the day this is pretty visible even though you can see it may come handy if
(02:38) you get the really volatile market having the high of the day may come helpful you know so you don't go long into the high of the day sometimes because that that can be a little bit tricky but you can easily easily just hide just click on the current day open high and low and you can just show low show low and show high ticket back to hide it and you can just have this piece of information for you so we're going to go back i'm going to try to show you guys how exactly we can benefit from paying attention to the market close
(03:15) because i personally don't use this indicator because i want to force myself to draw it and to find it you know myself so i'm really immersed in trading but for some of you you don't really want to waste the time so you can easily use this and this is very good for beginners to know that you have your key level drawn correctly you can see how the key level is reacting how the market close keeps you know showing you its validity and how important it is you get into this trading range and all of a sudden all these longs
(03:45) are very justifiable and once again we broke below this support and instantly continue working up higher there is another example previous day how the close of the day keeps reacting and we have a fail break above this prices are turning down here field break above this so you can you know you don't want to take trade is blindly please don't take it the wrong way don't just go out there and start you know plotting the close and just trading blindly you can but it is a very important and is a very useful tool to help you to predict the high
(04:16) probability setups when you know you're already trying to read the price action the same thing right here we have a little bit break higher we came back we tested the close of the day instantly turned down lower came back again instantly turned down and now we have a breakout pullback pattern and here is another perfect area if you are unsure whether you got your support drawn your key level drawn correctly this is how you can identify that you know there is some key level a lot of traders are going to be looking at the close of the day
(04:47) and they're going to be buying the market and once again the previous day so you can see that this indicator can become very useful the close of the day happen right here the orangish line orange line keeps showing you what the key level is going to be and how you can find the high probability setups here you know you can combine it with the rules that we are trying to follow but this is a helpful tool to help you predict the high probability setups but the market today started with a selloff we have a break and a new law we
(05:21) have a pullback at the ema in another attempt to retest the new low and prices spike through the ema two-legged move up and prices are continuing working higher so according to our rules we are expecting two legged pullbacks at the trend line but this is very early pre-market open and unfortunately we just get a first entry here but we are expecting with the break to have a new high and this is what it's called a pyramid pattern you guys can see that this is in shape of a pyramid so the first thing you would expect with the break of
(05:52) this channel is you would be expecting first you would be expecting some sort of support at the ema and possible re-test but here the support were nowhere to be found the price is just related up lower prices just rallied up lower and you have a first entry long at this bar but you know we are now deep below ema and this is starting to look like a lot of sellers are jumping into the market you have a pullback and you have a second entry long right here so even though this is a two legged move second entry long and we
(06:23) are waiting for a new high we're deeply below in ema and we are you know this leg up excluding this leg down was fairly strong so you don't want to go long this below ema after such a strong move down it still would have worked for scout this is why we scalp but that's not really the point we want to follow and find the highest probability setups and you have a first century short pullback second entry short right here but at the same time this is a little bit of a dilemma because trader is expecting a new high of this
(06:55) option working up higher but right now we are in an you know sort of consolidated market and this second entry short set up the trend line you have a lower high here but it is still way too early to go short in my opinion because the strong move up looked very strong but you have a new height right here you have a per century long pullback second entry long right here so this is the first good trade because at this point on the bulls the buyers they're clearly abandoned their you know initial idea to continue buying and the sellers are now
(07:29) overwhelmingly you know you know the majority in the market and this trend line it nicely confirmed the trailer because you can find the trend line of these first two swings this is how you normally find the trend line and the second entry long beautiful trap beautiful bearish reversal bar we confirm the trend line we're below ema and it is a failed second entry long this is we are not looking for second entry long now because we're in a downtrend we're looking for people who are trying to pick bottoms and we're going
(07:56) too long way too late so this was the first high probability setup according to our rules and prices continue working lower your first century short second entry short but the second entry short trigger triggered below this bearish bar which we you know cannot go short below because we are looking to sell so we need as bearish bars as possible but this bar this was a really good trap because you have a little bit of break and a new height of the very short term trend line the ema is holding prices once again this is why we plot the ema the trend
(08:29) line is holding once again so once again similar pattern to here and if it's some if you know general rule in price action if it works once very similar pattern it's most likely going to work twice so beautiful bearish reversal bar two key entry points high probability setup it is a form of a second entry even though technically it is a third entry short but you cannot really enter below this bar and you guys can see how nicely we traded up lower and here was the good trade that unfortunately wasn't takeable for us because the bar is way
(09:02) too big and it didn't really go much lower even though you guys can see the steam here this is not really what happened what happened live is we traded up lower lower lower and at the very end of the bar we started trading up higher and ended up like this so you you couldn't even sneak in with the limit order you just had to let this go but important to realize how important the close of the day the previous day is and just try to use this useful indicator to help you find the key level and prices just started to rolling up
(09:31) higher so you have to draw the shortened trend line to keep you on the right side of the market you have a break new high unfortunately only first trade well only first entry long and far away from ema so you cannot take this and you have a new high perfect price action we played out to the t so this uptrend is over and we should be expecting correction or possible reversal you're you're working up lower and once again your instinct what you should do first draw the shortened trend lines just draw them as much as you can
(10:02) to because it will really force you to follow the rules if you draw them because you can just try to eyeball them and if you're a little bit new you it will come back to bite you because you really need to draw them so you really know what to do and take a look how you have a slightly small little over overshoot right here and it led to a break the same thing happened right here you have a look how nicely it fits prices neatly overshoot and instantly leads to the brake so these overshoots they work the rules of overshoots are you know 95
(10:34) legit overshoots will most likely lead to break over trendline or even straight up reversal so we have a break attempt to make a new low potential support forming here you're working up higher you have a little bit of break it was a little bit tempting to go long here if we had a little bit better bar because we have a double bottom right here and the way we pushed above ema but right now you're at the middle of trading range and this signal bar is too too bearish to my liking so what i liked better is once we made this double top
(11:06) and i only made i only took two trades today this one and this one this was the second trade for me we have a trend line working up higher you have a break and a new height and you have a nice double top and a nice bearish bar and you're quite a bit away from ema so you're most likely going to pull back so what you can do you can once again draw it a little bit shortened trend line something like this doesn't have to be perfect oops doesn't have to be perfect you have a break new low and you kind of stopped in the middle of trading range
(11:43) and you came back and you have another setup and now this is a third confirmation of this resistance so i think and once again you get a nice bearish reversal bar really the signal bars today we're on point you know while we're trying to follow the rules and you show your working upload you have an overshoot which leads to a break and this is a lower high of desire and we're coming off the lows but we already this is the and look how little nuances price action is giving you we already because if this is a legit
(12:14) trading range this is your first thought when you're looking at this life like this if this is your uh this is a valid trading range you're supposed to go to this support you're supposed to go to the support support but twice we bounce fairly in the middle or the lower third so this was you know telling me that there might be some bulls in the market you know ready to buy so this lower high i don't really feel like taking this even though hindsight it obviously looks good but once you cannot even make it to the bottom right here it looks like we may
(12:47) actually break this resistance and keep working up higher and it didn't happen you have a break new low and here was the potential first loser that you could have gotten trapped here is this potential bounce of the support because you're not quite close to the support but you know it is you know some trader will definitely try to take it or try to sneak in with the limit order so this would be a potential loser there's really nothing you can do about this but once you get this filled brake lower below the resistance below the
(13:20) support and most breakouts will fail you want to definitely now go long because all these people that went short a little bit too early we're not close to the support yet but you know you cannot really play them this is a good signal bar but they went short they went along a little bit too early and they all were forced to you know get get out of their trades and they probably everybody re-entered right here and the market just continued working up higher so perfect key level again held the prices your first century short
(13:50) pull back second entry short and we are looking for failed second entry short in this instance because we're coming off to support and we are expecting for prices to go high like this but we're below ema here and you're starting to get a little bit of a congestion right here so what is better is to draw the trend line and you pushed above the ema so buyers are confirming that they are in the market and you have a nice reversal bar even though this is one tick bearish body at the very close of the bar we trade it up
(14:21) higher and this is how important it is to focus on the close of the bars not to trade when the bar is in the middle because this bar looked very bearish like we're gonna go lower and at the very end of the bar the key entry points ema and trend line held and it was the nice trade coming off the resistance and market just then continued to go into this congestion as you guys can see this little consolidation which you find the support you find the resistance support the resistance and you fade the breakout but to wrap it up uh very easy to read
(14:57) the price action today but trying to follow and use trying to use this indicator it will help you find the key levels and because some traders you know when i was starting i was wondering why the prices all of a sudden bounce off of here what was the reason that prices made it all down here and suddenly bounce what was the reason well this can help you identify the reason so i hope the video was helpful and i'm gonna see you guys in the next one take care everybody

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on traders now in this video i'm going to try to explain to you how to find a high probability setups while trading trading ranges and how to avoid taking losing trades because a lot of traders they love these big uptrends or these big downtrends because it's fairly easy to find some good pullbacks but if you master the skill of trading trading ranges successfully your trading will improve so in the first portion of the video i'm going to show you guys how i actually traded a trading range today live and i
(00:30) recorded it and you will see what is going through my mind how am i trading it when i see the trading range live prices print on the chart and in the second part of the video i'm going through all the reasons why i took the trade and how to find these high probability setups and what should you be looking for so if you just want to skip to part 2 and then go back and watch the live part that is a good option as well [Music] so
(01:59) [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so
(04:07) [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
(05:22) [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so you guys just saw how i traded the
(06:30) trading range and what was going through my mind as the prices were printing on the chart but let's now talk about how to find the high probability setups and how to avoid taking losing trades while we are trading trading ranges so the first thing we need to realize that the trading ranges is formed by a support and by resistance and that's the most important thing you need to do you need to find the current key level and this was the current high and this is the current low of the pre-market open session as i came in
(06:59) so what i did the first thing i'm going to do i'm going to try to find the key level i'm going to draw these lines on the chart so it helps me to remember where are the lows and where are the highs now the key with trading trading ranges is for most part to avoid trading in the middle and just focus on buying low and selling highs but more importantly the fading the breakouts because regardless of what you've been reading on all these forums on all these books most breakouts of trading ranges will fail just because
(07:34) one breakout out of 10 will eventually work and succeed doesn't mean that is a you know winning strategy most breakouts of these trading ranges will fail just like it's happening now live we broke the training trading range and we're going back into the trading range fading the trading range is the best way to find a high probability setup but now that we know that we are buying the lows and selling the highs that's not the only thing we are interested in i also need to draw the shortened trend lines because there's a rule in price action
(08:11) that just because trendline broke doesn't mean that the trend is reversing the traders will wait and will retest the previous high so in order for me to successfully buy the low or sell the high what i need to do i need to wait for previous trend to play out just like here we would see the downtrend working lower we have a break and a new low so from this point on the downtrend played out and it's safe for people to buy the market and they did we have option working low higher we have a break first leg to a new high
(08:41) pull back second leg to a new high we don't want to sell anything right here or buy anything we are in the middle so we wait for prices to go to the other side and here would be a good setup to take so this is pretty easy to identify this trading range and once again we have a trendline working lower we have a break and a new law right here so this was my first trade that i took you guys can see the big bearish bar you know a lot of traders are afraid to go long to buy this market after they see such a big bearish bar
(09:10) because it indicates a momentum all the indicators are showing you that sellers are in the market but is the thing with indicators indicators are lagging they always show you only after the fact so while traders are watching in real time everybody's thinking that there are sellers jumping and selling the market so they're afraid but there's a lot of institutions and a lot of small traders who are just keeping their resting limit orders in here and they will just buy blindly it's worth for them to buy blindly because if
(09:38) you're buying blindly three times a year it's it all three trades would have won and eventually one trade will fail so you still put your odds on your favor and i saw a big bullish reversal box so this was my first trade that i took and we are broken up higher and we have a first entry short this was the first attempt by the bears to continue to push market lower we pushed above the ema and the second entry short now i did not take this trade because i was still holding my my runner and that's the another important thing you need to
(10:07) realize when you're trading trading ranges you need to hold the runners you don't just want to be scalping because you catch some of the most you know some of the biggest trades that you can catch is when you buy the lows or you sell the highs or when you fade the breakouts this is the instance that you will catch the biggest runners as ever so don't just rely on scalping you want what you want to do is you want to scalp and scale out with the runner and hope for market you know to give you all the profits and this is a failed
(10:40) second entry short so this is a high probability setup this is notice how i marked only this one trade in the middle of trading range why because it is a failed second attempt that's second entries is a tie down to human psychology and we pushed above the ema ema was holding prices the trend line was holding prices this is what it's called a key entry point the trend line is key entry point and ema is key entry point and key entry point is the point when high probability setups occur so you always want to find the key entry points so this is 21
(11:09) bar ema and here was the little bit trickier thing that happened because we were supposed to go to the opposite side of the training she was supposed to go to the highs and we just didn't make it there is a gap and instantly sold off so i was a little bit hesitant to buy here there's not good signal bar either way but since we didn't make it to the highs of trading range there's something telling you that there are not a lot of buyers still left because you proper trading range you goes from one side to the other one
(11:37) side to the other all over the place here there is a gap so a lot of sellers starting to come into the market so you just want to be patient you have a low right here and once again first century short pull back second entry short this high probability setup we're not looking to short the market because we would be shorting the support we are looking for failures for a little bit weaker traders who want to go short into the support unfortunately this setup this signal bar is way too big for sticking to our rules but if we just
(12:06) had the better signal bar this is a two felt attempts in the previous direction once again we pushed above the ema and a nice bullish sentiment is now being established this is what we want to see and prices were working up higher we're working up higher we're now inside of this trend line and we come came back to this resistance we made this bearish bar and we instantly sold off this happened so quickly i wonder what this was you would have even got you wouldn't have even had a chance to enter this trade so and you cannot enter this late this
(12:38) trade would have already if you just sold this trade right here you would have got your scalp but it happened so quickly that it instantly came back and now you don't want to enter because your scalp portion is you know fulfilled and you want to wait for another opportunity but you guys can see even the selling the support steal it still worked but it is not ideal when the when you miss the trade and you want to chase it but we're still inside of this trendline so i might i recommend for waiting for break and a new high and now you guys see we
(13:10) pushed we broke the resistance and most people will tell you to buy the breakout but you don't want to buy the breakout you want to sell the breaker you want to fade the breakout sell the breakout to the upside and notice how we are far away from ema right here but we are still inside of this trend line so once we pull back to the ema pull back to this key entry point there was a still quite few buyers left in the market willing to buy and they just read the market up just a little bit created a double top and a big bearish reversal
(13:41) bar now this is telling you something the people went long on a breakout pullback trade and all they did is managed to push the double top right here and as most breakouts will fail once again those institutions the smart traders they will be looking to sell any breakout because all these people keep their stops right here and they want to leverage all these tops right here so this was my second trade that i took a nice birch bar a double top right here and you're still quite away from the ema it stalled a little bit but you guys can
(14:12) see how good of a trap it was because everybody was keeping their buy stop right here people went along right here and who went along right here after a failed breakout they all kept their stop right here and you guys can see what it did it did look how good of a trap this was this is how you can recognize the trap the momentum that's being generated by this trap is really substantial and we have this trend i'm working lower and i was holding my runner at this point on we have overshoot and overshoot of the trend line will at least
(14:39) lead to a break or possibly straight up reversal and you have the straight line working however your first leg two new height pull back second leg to a new high now you created a new high of this uptrend so this up trend is over because we have a new high we are retesting the resistance once again there's a three touches to the resistance and one push higher i tighten my runner and i got tapped stopped out unfortunately i should have kept my runner in place but i re-entered instantly once this is a triple top right here and one
(15:08) push higher this fell trap and a nice bearish reversal bar you know that you're probably going to push lower and once again my runner got stopped out once again but just remember this is the way you trade trading ranges you want to wait for prices to get to key entry points to these key levels and the reason why you don't want to be shorting just so quickly right here because the same thing that i was talking about here happened right here we were supposed to go to the other side but we bounced from the middle so i just don't
(15:37) want to short this even though this bounce off the resistance there is some sign that there's not many people left selling the market because it was supposed to go down here so you want to let the bulls get trapped so you don't want to sell here you don't want to sell in here and this is a triple attempt and we finally have a new high this high is higher than this previous high new high of this up trend so now it is safe to go long and you have a first century short second entry short be close below ema a big bearish bar ema ski entry point
(16:08) and such a gigantic bar where this is the first break of this channel so we are expecting a new low of this channel working lower we're coming off the field breakout so there's a high high chance we're going to go to the other side and once again we have a fail break lower and instantly pull back back into trading range so this is how you want to trade the trading ranges i know it's a little bit scary i know it's scary to sell the market this high but that's exactly how the market is designed market is counter-intuitive now i'm
(16:38) going to say once again the market is counter-intuitive forget everything you've learned in real life all your real-life experience because it is tempting to sell the lows and buy the highs because the market has proven to us that it is doing something market is proving to us that it's going higher or it's going lower but in trading you want to capitalize on exactly the opposite anything that makes common sense you want to throw it out of the window because trading doesn't care about your common sense you need to
(17:07) shift your brain and rewire it thinking only about what is happening on the market and following sticking to the price action rules you always want to stick to rules of your strategy and don't be afraid to take these trades because what you don't want to do you don't want to miss all these trades and then take one trade and that will be a loser you need to stick to your edge stick to your strategy and take all of these trades and you know you will be successful because there is no denying the price action right here
(17:35) works and you guys just saw it in my ra live real time example as i was look this is really the chart i'm filming this a few minutes after i'm done with this so you guys can see exactly how i draw the trend lines and what was going through my mind when i was watching charts print mark prices print on the chart so this video will help with you guys i really appreciate it you made it to this very end so hit the like button i really appreciate it and you can subscribe to the channel if you are interested in learning about
(18:01) day trading so i'm gonna see you guys in the next one and remember just forget about common sense

(00:00) traders hopefully you're doing well so i thought i would make a big video on how to trade technical analysis as simple as possible because what i think was the biggest breakthrough in my trading career was not just focusing on the patterns themselves but trying to identify the current market structure and what the prices are doing so we're going to use today as an example and the first thing i like to do when i'm identifying the market structure as i like to locate the most significant key level and i'm just not going to draw
(00:40) you know multiple lines on the chart what i want to do i want to find the one that is probably the strongest one and at the very close of the yesterday session i can see that we have a three matching lows so i'm going to plot horizontal line because we have a matching loss right here we came and confirmed it right at the start of the day and from that point on prices are in a trading range there is no clear uptrend and no clear downtrend i came somewhere around here so this would be what i saw so since i know i am in a trading range
(01:12) what i want to do i want to find the short term trend line because i want to know which trends has ended and which are still in the play because i want to take the trades on the proper side of the market we have this option working up higher we have a break attempt to make a new high we have this downtrend working lower we have a consolidation market and we have a second leg to a new low and this is the second leg this is the first leg measure it and this is the second lag and price is found support at the key level
(01:44) this is why we are trying to locate this key level and once again prices are trending higher so right now that the prices are trading higher and this is what i see when i am sitting from my chart and i'm trading today i'm looking at the break of this trend line so my first instinct is for prices to try to retest this uptrend because that's the rule of the trend lines after break of a trend line there's going to be a retest of a new extreme but i don't i just don't want to take any setup after break i want to take two legged pullback
(02:18) because a second entry is a high probability setup so what i would do is i would draw the shortened trend line and i would draw it because i want to see if this downtrend this correction that is right now is over because if i'm not letting this correction play out i may get trapped even though i'm still looking for an uptrend i still want to respect the current correction and the correction broke and we had a new low and here's the thing we are tr we are now located at the ema ema is one of the strong key entry points
(02:52) that prices are reacting to we have a double top right here we have a first century long pullback second entry long so this would be the first trade the first safe and high probability trade of today i'm still looking for prices to make a new high two-legged move to the ema to the key entry point and a nice signal bar prices made a new high instantly sold off lower and made another push higher so we have a swing right here and we we are continuing to work higher so there is something a little bit iffy right now because
(03:26) we keep working higher and higher so the best thing trying to find the key entry point is to take a look at what is the current trend line most likely going to be and using the first two swings is always the right way to find the trend line so you just copy it and you put it to the other side price is made in new high right here we have this downtrend working lower we have a tiny little break and new low and notice where the new low found rejection price is rejected right here the sellers off the trend line so right now this
(04:02) trend line definitely got confirmed and this is a first century long second entry long this would be a good setup if there was a little bit better signal bar unfortunately the signal bar is horrible looking doji and we we want to see a bullish momentum when we're bouncing off the trend line so this would be a fairly aggressive trade but it is a high probability setup because it is a two like a pullback second entry of the key entry point and prices continue working up higher so we're thinking that the market structure
(04:33) is bullish right now and we're looking for reasons to go long but we're now we're trying to find support at ema but take a look how prices cannot really go much higher or much lower in the matter of fact we are stacking next to each other this is a huge congestion congestion is just smaller trading range smaller consolidation of prices and it usually traps people in because it is tempting to go short and long at the same time so even though ema is putting support you have to respect the resistance and you have to pay
(05:09) attention how many bars are being stacked right here this is so many one two three four five six seven eight nine this is like 14 bars 15 multiple stims and the best way to trade congestion is to fade the breakout prices broke the congestion got rejected sellers once again got rejected off the trendline was previously confirmed and a nice bullish reversal pin bar this is now a good entry because there's a confluence of two key entry points it was just enough for a scalp but this is all we care about the runner is just a gravy and we are
(05:45) mainly scalpers when the trend line got broken we are still thinking that the market is going to retest this trend line working up higher and make a new high so we're not panicking we are not selling off the question here now is can we start selling the market and only if there is a high probability set up at the key entry point because the odds are the bias is still going to go higher and the boss are still going to look for re-test of this new extreme so this is just a first entry and this entry right here is far away
(06:21) from ema so there is no safe setup for us to take so we have to let this downtrend play out i'm going to draw my short-term trend line just to get the feel what the market is doing and prices started to make a little congestion right here we have a break and a new low of this downtrend but there is no setup for smart traders to take because there is no second entry and we don't want to go long below ema like this far away from the key level if prices touch the key level we can make a case for going long but we're not
(06:56) touching the key level we're below ema so longs are out of the question and shorts out of the question as well and notice how big bullish momentum right now happened these are four big bullish bars this is a this is what it's called a spike notice how we spike through the ema like it's not almost even there and four big bullish bar this bike right here is a little bit different from this bike because right here we have a bullish we have a bearish bars and the bullish bars have a lot of stems this right here are four clear bullish bars and we
(07:30) entered into spike and once prices made the top right here what i did i was trying to find some sort of potential channel because there is a pattern called spike and a channel and the bullish and this market structure right now is still bullish notice how we rejected the sellers right here pushed above the ema and we are now working to make a new high of this uptrend this was the first move of the uptrend let's say if we measure if we measure the move like this this is like one piece of black or we can measure it
(08:11) somewhere like this we are now working on our second leg higher this is the one piece this is the little bit of a correction and this is the second piece of a puzzle and notice how we are above the ema now we have a second entry long right here bouncing off the trend line and bouncing off the ema but i still think this is a little bit riskier trade because you don't want to have you don't want to happen will happen right here what is better to do is to wait for this breakout pullback pattern prices broke higher they broke
(08:46) the double top resistance pull back retested it off this is a triple touch of the trendline of the ema and this is a very smart entry to take i taking even the second entry here would be i mean smart so i'm going to mark it anyways because this you trading life you're not really sure but right here you got the channel confirmed really nicely and take a look how this price action is different from this one right here first of all there are many bars stacked next to each other and right here there are multiple gaps in between so this is not
(09:24) looking that cluttered but more importantly here each new low is higher than the previous one and each new high is higher than the previous one when you take a look at this lows are static they're not higher and you can even make a case for the highs being lower and lower it is almost tempting to look for some trend line something like this whether when you're trying to find the trend line something like this the each each high is higher than the previous one so it's really not letting you to find the downtrend in this instance it is fairly easy to
(09:58) find the downtrend so this is why this is a congestion and this is why there's little clues that are helping you that this is not a congestion this is just a rejection of prices off the key entry point and prices are right now working up higher we reach the top of the channel and this is what i want to talk about because we have a trend line we have a break and a new low we have a second entry long right here but a trigger above this doji with the bearish body so this is not what we want to see and the next bullish bar we didn't
(10:28) trigger above but the spike and the channel is looking something like this you have to remember that prices will not keep doing this forever eventually the channel will get broken this will happen and it normally happens when you go long way too late smart people smart traders are trying to find early entry as they can they want to find the entry right after they found the channel but people who went wrong long right here they went long after the entire move happened because they waited for market to confirm what's going to do probably because
(11:07) they're relying on common sense they wait for confirmation if you wait for confirmation you know what that means you're scared to take the trade and scared traders do not make money in this business so you have to let this play played out this downtrend this starting to get a little bit messy because ema is in the middle of the prices you have a congestion right here and there's a little trick for you guys if you have a spike and a channel what you can do a lot of times you can do and excuse me what you can do is you can
(11:42) measure you can measure the one tier and try to find what the second tier is most likely going to be and in this instance it worked something like this and now there is a reason why we can take this trade because we have a spike and a channel and we have a break so we are potentially looking for a new high here because the market structure is bullish but we don't want to go along below ema and now we have a bearish trap and a nice bullish bar right here high or low and if you are smart trader and you will measure the move of the tier right here
(12:21) and you copy to put it over you will see that there is a two-tier channel working upwards so this is a good long to take and prices are working up higher this is the new low of the move you have a first century short pullback second entry short we're not looking for shorts even though it's a second entry the market structure is up so we are looking only for reasons to go long just like here we were looking for only reasons to go long when we got the break we were sitting on our hands because we were waiting for the overall
(12:54) bias plus we could go short but there were no setups right here we're looking for reasons to go long felt second entry short is a trap but we are far away from both key entry points so it is better to wait when the prices get to key entry points you reach the new high you have this downstream working lower you have a tiny little break move to a new low and then you know doji bar we are at the key entry point price is made a quick easy scalp but the thing here is once again it is a horrible doji looking bar it is so tiny
(13:29) that it may be worth taking a chance here because you're risking almost nothing but you know it is fairly aggressive trade here and i may be looking at the possible setup as i'm doing the video so let's see if we get filled here because there is this trend line working up higher we have this trend line working up higher somewhere around here this channel just got broken this uptrend just got broken and i'm gonna found find my leg this is the one leg this is the second leg i'm going to move my target profit below the signal bar and you guys can
(14:09) see first leg correction second leg almost very measured to the t i'm going to go for eight takes because i don't want to get stuck here as i'm making the video i need to get out of here fairly quickly and we have a new law right here first entry short second entry short but we are below ema but we are looking for a new high because the market structure is up prices pushed above the ema this is good this is what i want to see the resumption of an uptrend and we have a nice bullish bar rejecting prices off the ema
(14:42) so hopefully we trapped some shorts we're trying to pick tops way too early while we are inside of this uptrend this is why identifying market structure is the most important thing try not to focus on the singular pattern just wait for the clear market structure you have to trust the process whoops and as the trade keeps working up higher we have a nice bar and this is not scripted obviously i didn't plan to do this but the trade set up so nicely that i thought i would take this trade so let's see what's going to happen
(15:23) but you know to go once again a little bit over what happened right here what i think can be tricky for a lot of people who are trying to go long after the move had happened already and you're going along way too late you got to wait for prices to do their thing at the end of the move because the channel is going to get broken at some point on you need to try to go along the early as you can this is why it is hard because it is scary a lot of people want to wait for confirmation but unfortunately if it would if it was that easy i mean
(15:57) everybody would be doing it we would all just be waiting for the market to prove us what it's going to do and we are two ticks away from getting actually i'm going to have to merge the country because i really have to run quick here i apologize i'm not going to make the entire uh chart review but there's enough there's plenty of market structure that you should be done fairly early and we are getting very close to getting filled it's 17 13 so come on and it was quick easy trade i was looking for prices to make a new
(16:30) high of this big uptrend just like i was looking here this downtrend has played out we had the two measured legs lower this is what i want to see so downtrend played out we pushed above the ema this was first entry long but that's not a problem because the ema is holding prices so nicely it's a third confirmation of a trend line and overall day is starting to look like a big uptrend you can see that every single selling opportunity is quickly rejected and every single time you get below ema here and here you quickly snap back so i hope

(270) 3 Simple Tips To Identify the Most Reliable Trendlines - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7wKNVCPx1A

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on traders so trend lines are indication of trend we already know that either uptrend or downtrend and trading trend lines alone can produce fairly consistent results definitely but we obviously wouldn't combine it with high probability setups such as second entries or failed second entries but what i want to give you guys here are the three tips on how to find the proper trend lines and i'm going to explain why we look for trend lines and why overall traders look for trend lines it is because there's a rule in price action after
(00:32) trend line will break prices will attempt to retest a new extreme this is why traders want to find proper trend lines because they want to see that the market is still trending or it is reversing but the first tip that i want to give you guys is regarding how do we find the proper trend lines because most people look for trend lines with the direction of the trend meaning if we are watching this uptrend people will find and look for trend lines off the lows now this is not that this is necessarily wrong this is definitely
(01:05) valid strategy but there's an alternative way how you can find better setups and early setups and that is look for a trend line off the opposite side meaning off the highs because if you take a look at this uptrend there are two ways how can we draw this trend line we can draw trend line something like this of lows and it is definitely valid this is not wrong but you guys can see how it doesn't fit off the top you have a break and a new high and look you have another break and another new high another break new high so it is
(01:35) definitely way too short term this trend line you know we keep working higher and higher so this trend line is probably way too short term what you can do is you can find the trend line off the highs and then put it off the lows now in this instance you can find the trend line off the lows as well and just confirm it off the height this is definitely okay but you guys can see how this trend line is much more robust fits prices neatly it fits off the highest and the lows and you have a break and in your height and just looks much better so
(02:05) always confirm it off the other side now get a lot of questions regarding how do we adjust trend lines how do we look for bigger patterns or do we straight up make a new trend lines and this is the second tip and it's regarding the looking for bigger pattern i cannot stress this enough and i'm going to emphasize this that when we look for bigger pattern we need to understand that the bigger pattern take time to develop you cannot be doing and looking for bigger patterns straight after the shortened trend line has
(02:38) played out meaning something like this this right here i mean i cannot tell you that this is wrong from strictly price action standpoint but i want to give you guys my tip that i eq tips that i've learned throughout the years of my trading that bigger patterns take they take time to develop and you need to give them more room and more space something like this i'm going to show you guys another example hopefully you will guys see it much better here we have this dungeon working over we have a break and a new low
(03:12) and what we can do we can be looking for bigger channel and bigger pattern something like this but this is still way too early after the first initial trend line finished price is neat more time we need a little bit deeper pullback deeper correction for the bigger pattern to establish and it will play throughout the day and here we have very similar situation once again looking for bigger pattern right after the short term one played out is not ideal prices need more room need more time to develop and the bigger
(03:46) pattern will come into play hopefully you guys can see the similarity with the previous example how prices really need time to work and find this bigger pattern so the same thing happened right here this was actually my trend line that i found and i post it to my community tab and the trend line came into play later on the day this was the picture that i posted you guys can see i was eyeballing it three touches off the top this right here just set up the trend line and it came into play later on throughout the day
(04:18) so once again remember bigger patterns they take time to develop you don't want to force it straight after the shorter month now i'm going to give you guys a little you know side tip and that is that the first trend line that you would see when you would be watching chart live is always the proper one the oldest one is always a problem and why do i mention this is because that was one of my main mistakes when i was trading part-time and i couldn't trade before the market open or at the market open i always came in late and i would be way
(04:53) too greedy i wanted to trade i wanted to take a lot of trades and i would ignore this break any new high and what would i do i would try to widen the trend line and kind of to refuse admitting that this trend line played out and it would be taking all these late longs all these trades they're wrong trades because they are not respecting that the first trend line played out remember the oldest one this is the first one is the oldest one is the oldest channel this right here is the first channel you would draw when you'll be watching
(05:25) market print real time so always pay attention more to the first trend line to the first channel that you would see you don't want to be widening the channels looking for more entries just because you entered late and the third tip regarding trend lines is regarding a bigger pattern because i had a question asked me by a trader multiple traders what do we do when we have a confluence of trend lines we have a bigger pattern and we have this downtrend working lower and we don't have a break in a new world new low because in ideal world we would
(05:59) love to have a break of this downtrend and a new low so we can safely take this long but we don't have this here and this you will see this a lot throughout your trading career when you will have two conflicting beliefs your two conflicting trend lines and the bigger pattern is always more important the bigger pattern takes precedence and is more significant like seven or eight other times the bigger pattern will prevail and this is how we get an edge and how we can make consistent money so you know i wouldn't blame you for
(06:34) sitting on your hands here because you want this shortened trend line to play out yes but remember if you're struggling and if you're asking yourself these questions always remember that the bigger pattern has more strength and my first trade for the day was this trade right here i initially wanted to make video about this pattern but i figured it would be great to mention how to look for trend lines and i'm definitely going to talk about this pattern later on so we're definitely going to see this pattern in the future
(07:03) we basically had a nice trap it is you know the opposite of a bottoming pattern so i took this trade because this option already played out with the break and a new high we have a big bearish bar that pushed through the ema and we broke this low we pulled back to the ema in a nice big bearish bar breakout pullback pattern but more importantly this option played out quick easy scalp we had this uptrend being set up and confirmed obviously we look for high probability setups and the high probability setup was right
(07:35) here unfortunately i missed this one we have a new law right here first entry short we trigger one tick lower bill of this second entry short nice big bullish bar we're holding above the ema unfortunately the trade rolled up higher really quickly i missed this trade i was actually about to post my chart here and there are few very tempting trades to take here because we have a possible trend line or just the ema about first entry double top first entry so just first entry so i think it's better to sit here and wait
(08:09) and prices are giving you now signs that the uptrend is becoming more valid you have a new high right here this height is higher than these ones first century long pullback second entry long high probability setup two like a pullback we have a break and a new low attempt to make a new low we can't because there are two key entry points in the way very high probability set up second entry long we have a first century long pullback second entry long right here and we have a first century short pullback second entry short failure right here
(08:37) once again off the trend lines and off the lows but i'm gonna give you guys what i was thinking right here i didn't took these trades because i was being afraid of going along into the very highs of the move of the day because what can happen and i made a video i mentioned this in the video simple tips on how to identify market structure is when you have a spike and a channel prices cannot go indefinitely like this eventually the channel will get broken the channel will eventually be broken this prices cannot do this
(09:12) forever and normally this will happen after prices have made already significant move look at how big this spike in a channel is and you're going long after all that happened now a lot of novice traders will get trapped here because market has proven to them that we moved up higher like this but you want to do the opposite you want to find the trades as the market is establishing this channel not already too late after this entire move happened so take that into consideration you probably would have gotten trapped
(09:45) here nevermind that comes to the territory but throughout your experience you can recognize that you cannot go long after way too you know after this move has played out already we already talked about this trade we had another nice confirmation of this bigger trend and once again ema is holding prices nicely so once again two key entry points you know very tempting trade nice reversal bar but you're starting to form this wedge pattern and you're close to this resistance and what i was afraid happening exactly like this you have a break of
(10:19) this uptrend but do we show it here or do we go long here well we don't do anything here because we don't want to short because this is an uptrend that is just the first break of this channel but we don't want to go short either excuse me we don't want to go long either because we need to let this correction play out it played out nicely and we pushed above the ema strong spike up we have a new height this height is higher than this one first century long second entry long ema is holding prices nicely strong bullish reversal bar once again a
(10:53) perfect trade hopefully you guys had a good day today we are keep making new highs quite you know impressive hopefully you guys had a great day uh put it in the comment section if you did because yesterday and today were really easy up trends yesterday was spectacular uptrend early on there are so many second entries of key entry points in an uptrend so if you guys had a great day please let me see it in the comment section and if you guys enjoy the video if you got any value from this hit the like button subscribe to the

Transcript:
(00:00) what is going on traders so in this video i'm going to talk about how to take advantage of a good setup and we're going to talk about how to maximize our profits by adding on or scaling into our trades i'm going to outline few rules that need to be met in order for us to successfully add on our contracts because a lot of beginners can get this wrong very very quickly and they can end up losing the twice of their initial position so we're going to talk about that so that that wouldn't happen and the video is going to be divided into
(00:30) two parts so in the first part of the video you're going to see my live training today and how i added on my contracts today live and the second part of video we're going to talk about what was going through my mind as i was looking at the chart and i'm going to explain you my thought process behind me taking these traits so without further ado let's dive into [Music] this [Music] [Music] [Music]
(02:07) so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
(03:42) [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
(06:15) [Music] [Music] [Music]
(07:34) [Music] [Music] so
(08:41) [Music] so this was my trading today and i'm gonna talk about the rules that need to be met in order for me to successfully add on and there are four rules number one that the setup has to be with trend setup the second rule is there has to be second entry because second entry is a high probability setup market moves in twos third rule is it has to be at the key entry point because that is the place where high probability setups occur and fourth rule is that the previous correction the previous trend in the bigger trend
(09:30) has to play out so now we're gonna dive into these rules more deeply the first rule that is being met we can check this rule because the downtrend is strong prices are making lower highs and lower lows ema is pointing lower keeps rejecting prices there are clear trend lines in play for sure downtrend we are only looking for reasons to go short we are not buying this market at all this is a falling knife and we don't want to catch it so the second rule is it has to be second entry second entry in itself with trent is a
(10:04) high probability setup this is the new right here first century short pull back second entry short this is the first lag that market made and pull back second lag so this is a two legged move up third rule it has to be at the key entry point the key entry point right now here is the ema and the fourth rule is that the previous correction has to play out we have this uptrend working higher we have a break and a new high so after break over trendline is going to be retails of a new extreme and that will conclude this current trend so all the rules are
(10:40) being met now i'm just going to give you guys a little side note here that when i talk about adding on i mean that my initial position is still in play i haven't been filled in my initial entry meaning i never add on when i already scalp and i'm holding a runner and then i see a good setup that's not a good scaling in opportunity i only scale in when i'm still in the my first position and i haven't scalped out yet so it was the second entry short at the ema in a huge huge downtrend and prices take a few ticks lower and
(11:17) turned up higher so this right here was a trap to trap early bulls who are trying to go long way too early we don't have a break and a new low yet in this instance so people thought they trapped people like me going short here on a second entry short but this is a strong downtrend and they take a few ticks higher and instantly reverse and i guarantee you everybody who went along here started to panic because they're going along way too early in a in a huge downtrend this trade right here is still part of a second entry that's the point here
(11:50) i'm still holding my trade i'm still inside of my second entry this slow right here this high right here is lower than this high so this is just a lower height setup and a nice bearish bar and the reason behind adding on here is that this is a second chance for us to enter and this is the main thing that i want you guys to take away from this is if as you are watching a good setup at the key entry point and you're scared to enter a market makes a trap and you have you know identical entry this still part of the second entry you
(12:23) get identical entry this is a second chance for you to enter that's the whole point in adding on because you can miss the first attempt and it just makes a little trap trap a few people who are trying to you know counter generate early and you get a second chance to enter and it ended up working nicely so hopefully you guys get a grasp on how why i adding on here and how to add on and you have to be very careful with adding on you have to be experienced trader if you're a novice trader forget about adding on just focus on
(12:55) spotting the proper setups but i know there are a few advanced traders that watch my content as well and are interested in adding on so this is how i manage adding on and this is how i scale in and overall you know i was done with trading by this moment but as i was recording i wanted to show you guys more trades so i scale down to just one contract because i want to show you guys how i take trades and i only took this this was my last setup so for you guys who are wondering why did i go to one contract because i
(13:28) was already quite tired and i didn't want to risk giving my money back after such a quick easy day so it's scaling back one contract you know if i have a loser nothing really that bad happened but the thing here today is to recognize the entire structure because this is a huge downtrend this is a falling knife and beginner traders really try to pick bottoms because they keep thinking that the market moved a lot and there is no way it's going to move lower again it already move down so much it has to reverse it has to reverse
(14:02) this is what they're looking for but no market keep going lower and keep going lower this is how the trend works we have a break and a new low so this uptrend played out there is a key level right here that i found and there's a key level here that i found you guys saw it live now why don't we take this key level entry right here because this is a triple top right here well the biggest downtrend is very strong this is a huge move down we don't just rely on key levels as a pattern we are not patent traders we rely on the overall
(14:34) market structure prices broke lower came back in the trading range i was attempted i was attempting to take a trade here if we broke lower because this would be first century short second entry short below ema it didn't happen prices came back in the trading range here right right here is the situation that really you need to be afraid of to be honest with you because this is a congestion prices are in the middle of those bars excuse me ema is in the middle of those bars prices are going next to each other side by side and we are in the middle
(15:05) of this trading range so this is a congestion this is a consolidation you skip trading this and you wait for failed breakout but prices broke higher found resistance at the key level and nice bearish bar is a failed breakout so this is my second trade that i took and my running got stopped out and there's a lower high that in hindsight i think it was a very good setup this is the lower high of this high so we're coming off the highs we're pushing through the ema we definitely pushed through ema right here pull back felt second entry short
(15:36) high probability setup below ema beautiful reversal bar i tried to get in but i chickened out of this trade i got too scared you know i kicked myself afterwards that will hap that's what happens there's a second entry short right here once again second entry market moves in twos but we're far away from ema and i don't think this is a smart entry because we already once again made a new low price is made a measured move to the measured second tier of a trading range very similar so this is a two tier trading range measured move down
(16:07) and market is starting to reverse at this point because we already have a break and definitely a few new lows of this bigger downtrend and we have a dungeon working lower we have a break and new low and we have a micro double double bottom right here and prices look how prices pushed through the ema strong move so i think this was a good trade to take and prices made the second leg up this right here is the first leg working higher this right here is the second leg working higher i was contemplating taking these trades
(16:38) but i didn't and i made a mistake because on a five minute chart look at the nice entry this was on a five minute chart it was a first entry short second entry short at the key entry point so had i been looking at the five minute chart that would prompt me to take this trade but i missed that and you know this is why it was such a great trade market already made a two lakhs this uptrend played out with the break in a new high so time to look for shorts prices made a double bottom and once again take a look how all the magic happens at the key entry
(17:08) points forget about taking all these iffy setups they're really not the ones double bottom right here market is reversing we have a break attempt to make a new high and we push below ema nice bearish reversal bar i thought we could make move lower but we ended up reversing and it's no surprise market is already reversing and on a five minute chart as well so no surprise we are already working higher but you know hopefully you guys now understand how i head on hopefully you guys enjoyed the video you get any value from this if you do
(17:39) please hit the like button i would really appreciate it subscribe to the channel if you haven't and just wait for the key entry points if you guys take a look there was so many second entries at the key entry points it's it's a shame that this was you know pre-market open if this was a regular market opening and trading couldn't be easier so you know hopefully this was helpful and i'm gonna see you guys in the next one take care everybody

Transcript:
(00:00) today i started my first trade with the losing trade and this was the trade right here and then i tried to follow up after this two-legged pullback and failed trap to the short side i waited for this bar to finish and put my limit order in and market went without me and left me hanging and i had a flashback to my earlier days of trading because what would happen earlier when i started trading was after me having a losing trade right here and after me missing a trade right here i would get very angry i would get very
(00:32) depressed and i would probably be revenge trading i wanted to take my money back that market stole from me quotation mark stole from me i will probably end up taking this second entry long horrible doji bar below ema after the market depleted with the break at a new high and i would end up with two losing trades and one missing trade and i would be specifically mad at the market and i would be questioning the market why is the market doing this to me why is the market taking my money away from me when i've done nothing wrong and you
(01:06) know i'm just good human person human being i help some homeless people i don't steal i have never committed crime why can't i make a consistent income just 100 bucks per day 100 bucks a day why is this market doing this to me i was this gullible and you know i wasn't really comprehensive on how market operates but market isn't here to take our money market isn't here to give us money either market is just is doesn't care about us we're just retail traders institutions doesn't care don't care about us the markets
(01:37) are neutral all these sticks that you see on a chart print on the chart are neutral if you look at the chart and something may something cause you feel emotional pain this is just the emotional pain you have inside of you and you project it onto the charts but what would also happen i would end up with these two losing trades one missing trades and i would be so angry that i would be not able i would be paralyzed i couldn't force myself to take the good trades at the key entry points throughout the rest of the day the high probability setup
(02:11) they're easy to see and i wouldn't i would be too scared to take these trades because i already had two losing trades and i would be just confused is this the accurate representation of my trading skills like this is not me why am i not able to take these easy trades and i just skip the rules right here i try to outsmart the market what is this just just because something happened right here this is not how i trade this is not how i am what is happening and that's unfortunately the emotional side that is inside of us
(02:40) we have to get rid of these emotional demons every traitor has these emotional demons i mean it is a nature part of our mental makeup it is inside our heads our mind have a defense mechanism just as as we when we put our hand on a hot stove we will instantly jerk back without even thinking about this it is subconscious but our minds have the same thing meaning if we have a losing trade it will tap us into all the bad memories we have in the all the bad things we are dealing with mark douglas he talked about this in much more detail
(03:13) definitely recommend studying his material but when we have a losing trade you may start thinking about you know the bad things are happening in your life you may you know start being very depressed oh my god i hate my job i can't make money trading you know i just argue with my wife we're about to get divorced or whatever my kids hate me you know whatever the thing it is you know you and your friends don't get along that's really not that has nothing to do with your trading and you have to take control over your
(03:43) emotions you cannot get angry over losing trades losing trades are a part of your trading everybody has losing trades there are going to be days when you're going to open up your chart you're ready to trade you're excited and you have a first losing trade straight out of the gate you have a losing trade and will completely mess you up those days are going to be there you have to take that into consideration there are going to be days when you will miss two two trades in a rows you will get left behind that's all part of trading
(04:13) because trading is only mental there is not there's no physical activity required for trading only physical or quality is us moving our hands and clicking to put our order in place other than that it's all mental so you know i want to share with you guys you know what was going through my mind when i started trading and what what would be my mental hurdles and what would be worse is this this was even not following my rules this was just a first century long and we're far away from ema i just took a losing trade and i didn't even need to
(04:47) take a losing trade that's probably what will get me really get me and my ability to read the chart i mean i could still read the chart well i could see you know how the trends how the trades can probably win but i couldn't force myself to take these trades i want to talk about this specifically on friday because we have a weekend ahead of us and i want you guys to reflect back on your trading and how you did well mentally because nobody is going to talk about this i know everybody likes to read about the best trading patterns
(05:16) and nobody is going to tell you the truth behind trading you know the gurus won't tell you this in their course that trading is really it's not easy as it seems even though it is very doable but it is not just easy because you will never get rid of this mental uh these these mental barriers you you will never get rid of this after 10 years of trading you your mind will still be susceptible to be thinking like this you have to constantly combat it every single day it will get much much easier trust me it will be very very rare but you're
(05:50) always susceptible and you always have to remind yourself the markets are random that you know it is not personal and anything can happen any setup can fail and you shouldn't be really celebrating your winning trades either because winning trades are like a sun you know sun is going to shine at some point in our lives on everybody so you have a 50 50 chance on every single trade to have a winning trade so you cannot get you can get ecstatic about winning trade you cannot get depressed about losing trade market is random and more importantly you don't
(06:25) have to prove anything to anybody this this business this is only about making money you're not proving to your family hey look at me i'm a trader i made it you're not showing off to your friends you're not a hero you know people have crazy reasons why they pick up trading this is only a business for making money nothing else you don't have to tell nobody you have to prove nothing to anybody that your stock market trader i mean it sounds cool but you know reality is a little bit different so hopefully you guys
(06:56) find this useful because i know a lot of you feel the same way i mean every trader feels like this at some point in their trading career because we all have the same our minds are fired the same way and we have to put you know strong effort to fight this mentality that is our mind you know causing us to think but today we started with a trading range but we traded up into this trading range and we were making higher highs like here and higher lows so there is an upward bias into this trading range and i was looking at this trend line when i
(07:30) found this from the first two swings you always want to check for the bigger pattern as early as you can and this confirmed the trendline we broke higher prices are above the ema and this is a failed break below above the trading range and most breakouts of trading ranges will fail so no surprise prices came back and this pattern is called a breakout pullback pattern we broke higher we pull back and breakout pullbacks pattern are very very sketchy patterns i normally don't take breakout pullbacks unless they are really really reliable
(08:05) and they're really reliable when they are at the multiple key entry points and what it is a second entry unfortunately here this is just a first entry but what i like about this trade is how we ticked one tick lower bill this bar and instantly reverse up on a nice one bar but there is a support holding that acted as a resistance there is an ema and there is a potential trend line so there is a there was a three key entry points you probably wouldn't have the trendline in play yet so there are two key entry points
(08:35) still good enough this is the upper buys and market is just working higher and higher the reason for me why i took this trade because initially i was looking at something like this this is what i would be looking at and i was expecting prices to reverse from here and go at least to the potential midline but we kept working higher and kept working higher so i thought this is a trap to trap all the shorts who are picking the tops and this is going to be one of those strong ball days and we have a first break of this trend
(09:05) line and this is the first entry long we are not to the ema and we don't have a new low of this downtrend so this is not according to the rules that i teach yet i still pull the trigger right here i thought it was worth the risk because this looked very strong and i got punished for that i got left behind here because this is already two like a move down first leg pull back second leg first entry short second entry shot but you don't want to go short yet because this option is strong ema is pointing higher and we are
(09:36) waiting for a new high of this option because that's the rules of trend line prices made a new high here and we are working lower from this point on this new with the new high you know this uptrend depleted we have a first century short second entry short that is confirming the trend line it is confirming the ema big berry signal bar and you have a room to get to this trend line right here i think this is a good trade that we potentially can trade prices confirm this trend line this is a four bounce of this trend line
(10:11) even though you can take this trade because the bigger pattern will most of the time prevail like it is here it prevailed but what i recommend for you guys is to wait for market to prove that other traders have the same intention and the price what is preferable here is for prices to push above the ema and then ema is showing sign of strength that buyers are willing to go into the market but it didn't happen instantly reverse there was no failed second entry short we have a break first leg to a new low pullback second leg to neutral so this
(10:44) downtrend played out and i didn't have this downtrend in play yet this is what i would be looking at so what i'm looking at here is i'm seeing a two-tier channel working higher even the midline fits nicely and this is the first break of this uptrend so i'm expecting for prices to get higher so when we have a first century short we pushed above the ema and a second entry short right here that fits off the ema and fits the trend line two key entry points running congruently i like that trade at the time because i thought that we're going to
(11:16) make a new high and this is a failed second entry short prices were for whatever reason made the triple top right here and instantly reversed lower uh then i draw this trend line you can see it fits nicely off the lows right here it confirmed the lows right here and we pushed massively below the ema so this is telling you that the you know bus is shifting a lot of people are starting to sell and you have a first entry shot but we don't want to take first entry that's not a high probability setup we have a second entry show right here
(11:46) prices break this uptrend correction attempt to make a new high ema's holding prices double top right here big bearish bar so i think it is good trade to take because right now in a downtrend prices are making lower highs lower lows and the reason why i like this trade because it's a first century long pullback second entry long and ema is still holding prices below we cannot close above the ema no matter how try how hard we try and price is pushed lower pull back to the ema unfortunately it is the first entry and here would be a
(12:18) great buying opportunity normally when you have an overshoot like this and you have a open of the day or close of the yesterday this is normally good key level where prices will give you opportunity to go long this is also why i don't like taking the shorts right here because we overshot the market and always we will most of the time lead to break off this trend line it also starting to look congestive like i mean i'm not gonna lie this trade right here looks very tempting it is very similar to this right here you have a
(12:54) one two three moves higher one two three moves higher but this is looking congestive and you you may say right now hey tom but this looks like a congestion as well why is this okay and this is not okay well this is simple we have an overshoot right here right here we're in the middle of the trend line and we're expecting for prices to reach down here we are overshooting here and we're most likely you can see what's going to probably happen we're gonna go here this is very tempting i'm not going to lie this is very similar to this trade
(13:23) but you know i think it's better to just sit on your hands what i would like to do if price is pulled back below ema give you a lower high that would be much better or felt second entry loan it would be even better but market just took off lower we broke the major key level and we keep working higher and higher as expected so you know i jumped the gun here uh missed a trade here but luckily i'm you know i'm able to trade without emotions but you know really pay attention to your mental you know mental side of trading to your mental
(14:01) makeup don't neglect it because you can it's more important when you build a foundation and you have a strong mind your technical skills will only add up and it will increase exponentially you will get better better but you can be the best analyst in the whole world but if you can't keep your emotions in check you can never make this so we have a weekend ahead of us reflect back on your trading and you know hopefully this video was helpful if it was i'm glad and i'm gonna see you guys in the next one take care everybody



(270) How do Professional Traders Buy the Low - A Complete Guide - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KH4VvrFD8ag

Transcript:
(00:00) what is going on traders in this video we're going to talk about how to buy the low but not just to how to buy it but how to buy it as a high probability setup because when i started trading i never believed to these traders they were reliably selling the highs and buying the lows with consistent results but after almost eight years of trading it has become one of my go-to setups and i think it would be a shame not to share with you guys so i'm gonna try to explain it to best of my abilities and give you the tips what i'm looking for in the
(00:28) first part of the video we're going to explain the technical analysis aspect of this how we recognize this pattern in the second part of video i'm going to show you guys my live trade that i took right here that i attempted to buy the low so the first step is when we are picking the top or picking the bottom and more likely buying the bottom or selling the highs is that we need to identify the market structure because it needs to be trading range it cannot be trend uptrend or downtrend when the market is trending
(01:01) we are obviously only sticking with the trend we don't want to be taking unnecessarily risk to be picking tops or bottoms we just want to buy ourselves the pullbacks and keep going with the flow so it has to be a trading range and it is pretty obvious when we first came in and looked at the chart market started with one big leg up we went into congestion fell break lower and prices attempted to make a new extreme as i came in this is still pre-market open session as i came in price is pushed below ema and prices are
(01:31) continuing working lower so this is not a strong uptrend not a strong downtrend this is looking like a trading range structure the second step is that we need to make sure that the downtrend is going to finish is going to play out the current trend is going to finish and how do we recognize that the trend is finishing well we recognize it by the break of a trend line and a new low because after trend line will break traders will attempt to make a new extreme we have a break right here and prices continue to make new extreme
(02:04) so as i came in we push below ema prices are working below ema and take a look how we keep breaking these lows each times every single structure low is being broken broken broken so this is a good sign that we are in a downtrend or we are heading into downtrend we have a break of this downtrend and you're most likely heading to these to this low this is the close for yesterday i mean the closer is that it is a little bit higher but i put it a little bit lower because you can see multiple touches right here so we're most likely heading
(02:36) from one side of the trading range to the other side of the training range and the third step when we are buying the low is we prefer it to be a break below a key level because most breakouts of trading ranges will fail so it's not bad it's not wrong to buy the support but we want to buy it we want to fade the breakout we want to wait for the break below the key level because that's the easiest way how traders can get trapped and now take a look at this pattern that i i'm going to try to describe to you when we are looking to buy the low
(03:12) like i already mentioned the price structure needs to be range we the downtrend need to finish and we need to break below the key level we have this strong bearish move down this is wanna see the stronger the move the better i know it sounds counterintuitive why would be you know wanting to buy after strong bearish move but we wanted the stronger the move the better it is because most people are going to get trapped so what you're looking for is a strong bearish move followed by a depletion candle take a look at this doji this right here
(03:43) is a depletion of this entire move after that there will be an indecision phase decision phase is clearly highlighting that the market is depleting the previous strong bearish move this area right here is the indecision you guys can see how we're trying to go higher and we're trying to go lower it's no longer a strong strong continuation of this bearish move and we are no longer going higher and breaking above so this is the indecision after depletion but more importantly here comes the most important part that i want you guys to pay attention to
(04:20) because the whole idea behind buying the low below the key level and fading the breakout is that we want to be on the other side of the traders of the beginner traders who are getting trapped because i guarantee you so many traders watch this entire downtrend working lower working lower and they were scared to pull the trigger all the way up here and they're going to go short below the breakout after all that move happened they're going to be a lot of traders who are going to be piling in because it is a common sense market show you
(04:52) that is trending down now this is a common sense and you don't want to be following common sense when you're trading so market proven it's going down you have a new low right here this is the low for the day you have a first century short pullback second entry short this is a trap because second entry is a high probability setup we're coming off to ema but remember we broke lower most breakouts will fail it is in decision area it is looking like a it started to like a bottoming pattern sort of felt like an entry and a nice bar to go
(05:23) long so this was my first entry for today and actually a very similar situation happened yesterday when i was filming the video is that we have this low right here for the day prices we're continuing broken lower we have a break and a new low so the downtrend played out it is a trading range looking structure we broke below the key level we have a strong bearish move down we have a depletion candle oops we have a depletion candle right here a little bit of indecision i pulled the trigger way too early looking back in hindsight this is the
(06:04) trap i should have been waiting for first century short second entry short this would be the trap to trap all the shorts going short after all the move happened very similar pattern very high probability all these patterns will repeat this was my first trade and as price is pushed above the ema and this key level is now holding as a support the ema is holding a potential trend line is holding and the support is right now holding so this was my second trade and i caught quite a nice runner right here unfortunately i got stopped
(06:37) out here but this is how i'm looking to buy these lows it is very counter intuitive and it is scary but when it's a trading range it is such a high probability setup because so many people are going to get trapped down here you can almost rely on it and even though you're close to this ema right here the overall context is here so strong that you just have to pull the trigger right here and prices kept working unfortunately i don't see really good setups for today there is a second entry show right here but you're inside of this trend line
(07:08) another entry here but once again you're inside of this trend line so you don't want to risk taking this first entry right here then you're working higher uh here's the first century long pull back second entry long but bar is way too big so only you you could enter on this inside bar it would be pretty great entry following our is a failed break lower in and up trend ema is holding but you know other than that once again not that many high high probability setups but i'm going to quit talking a gorgeous trade today and hopefully you

(270) Understanding Hidden Moves (Secrets) In Price Action | Stock Market Technical Analysis - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YuPbI4FE2M

Transcript:
(00:00) so what exactly are hidden moves and how can we take advantage of these moves and i want you guys to bear in mind that when i'm talking about hitting moves i mean they are related to high probability setups and high quality setups are two-legged moves second entries at the key entry points because this is the what the strategy is based on and we're only looking for highest priority setups as possible so we don't care about hidden moves they're on the chart somewhere in a no man's land we only care about the hidden moves they are connected
(00:29) to otherwise high quality setups and under right circumstances and there are two examples of hidden moves i want to talk about those today this is my first trade that i took today and i shared shared it with my community and just to get the idea why i took this trade let's talk about and let's take a look at the structure because market strike started with an uptrend looking like wipe and we definitely started trending strongly we are making higher highs high lows this two-tier channel keeps working and looks valid
(01:00) prices are above the ema and ema is pointing higher so i'm only interested in reasons to go long i'm only interested in buying i there is no strong bearish momentum proven yet and this is probably people taking profits and ema is still holding so i'm only looking for reasons to go long this is the new high the market made and prices were continuing working lower now when i'm looking for reasons to go long i still need to pay respect to this downtrend correction because there's a rule in price session after break of a trend
(01:30) line market will make a new low so after this trend line broke and made a new low that's when i'm safe to keep continuing looking for setups to go long and now let's talk about the hidden move because technically this right here is a first entry because if you take a look take a look at these bars we didn't trigger higher above neither of these bars we're working lower working lower first entry long right here but if you take a closer look doesn't this look like a two-legged move this is the first lag you're working sideways and you have a
(02:04) second leg it does look like a two-legged move to me you have a break new low if you take a closer look what is happening at the ema we're working sideways and it is a bullish bar at the ema which means the people are attempting to go long here i know we didn't trigger higher so the entry didn't happen but there are people trying to go higher have we checked the lower time frame we would definitely see a first century long right here and a second entry long right here but we don't need to go in the lower time frame
(02:30) because we already have the perfect time frame for scalping this is d2000 tick chart and which is very similar to three minute chart or one minute chart depends on the volatility so we don't have to go on a lower time frame but this is how i use the hidden move i treated it as a first century long pullback second entry wrong right here but once again why did i treat it like this i didn't just look at this and said wow you know i'm just going to bend the rules right here i'm not i'm not going to count it as a first
(02:56) entry no all other factors are being met all the factors of our strategy are being met meaning we are in an uptrend we just broke this spike any channel so we are waiting for a new high we are we close above the ema this is a nice bullish bar and we have a break and a new low so this would be a second entry long under the correct you know circumstances this would be a high quality setup so this right here was just didn't move and i used it to my advantage another hidden move was right here and once again we only used it
(03:29) under the right circumstances we are in an uptrend we broke this major channel working higher so you know what's going to happen yes the traders are going to attempt to make a new high and you keep working above the ema take a look we have a double bottom right here first break of this bigger channel double bottom you're pushing higher pushing higher and you're pushing hyper channel first century show right here so this is technically just a first entry but take a closer look this definitely looks that there were people
(03:56) selling at the ema because after this bullish bar there's a purge bar right here and another bearish bar right here so you can treat it as a percentage short pull back second into short ema is holding prices and this is looking like a reversal pattern so this is once again a hidden move right here now i don't want you guys to just take this concept and run with it and start looking for a bunch of sketchy trades no hidden moves are rare and 95 of your trading even more are going to be nice clear second entry something like this
(04:29) at the key entry point so should you be too confused and to worry about this absolutely not but should you be aware of this and you know take advantage of this after years of experience definitely so this is why i want to make a video about this so you guys know that hidden moves are there that there you only use it as a supplement to otherwise high probability setup because this right here would be first century short second entry short if you just take a look how here the people started saying eem selling at the ema but once again you
(05:02) don't have to worry about the hidden moves so much especially if you're new trader definitely worry about it this is just for a little bit more advanced traders who you know understand the concepts and who can take advantage of the hidden moves safely and if we want to find the high quality setups we need to start with understanding the market structure as this printing on the chart today we wouldn't see this uptrend of course you would only see this small little piece of chart and once when you take a look at this
(05:34) chart you don't really have the bigger channel all you have to go through and all you have to follow are your shortened trend lines so you would draw these shortened trend lines you have a break and a new high perfect price action you're working lower something like this you have a break and a new low perfect price action you have a double bottom right here and market keeps working higher we broke to the upside why because market traded into the trading range so you are expecting breaks higher now most breakouts will fail be pushed
(06:02) higher broke and continue working lower and by the way i had my bars a little bit different than now uh when i was trading it live but never mind this is the double bottom right here and prices are pushing through ema first century short pullback second entry short second entry is a high priority setup two legged moves are high probability setups you will see them all over the chart there are high priority setups second inches are very reliable smart traders take advantage of these setups it is tied down to human psychology
(06:32) you don't really need to go in too much details it just works so this is the second entry short but we're not looking to reasons to sell because this is starting to look like an option we are pushing higher above the ema so this would be first century show second short failure that is what we are looking for however this bar unfortunately is way too big for proper risk to report management ratio so you just have to sit on your hands and let this go there is a first century long pullback second entry long right here
(06:58) and i would mark this trade but when i was watching this live i thought this could be an overshoot because i had my channel like this and i wasn't really sure i thought this would this could be an overshoot i probably played a little bit too cautious so you know this is not a bad setup but in my opinion slightly aggressive once we made this spike and went into this channel but you could you could find after these lows you have to now realize that this is a starting to be very strong channel i know it doesn't look like this
(07:29) but trust me it is a very strong channel then you see it's very strong trend when you see a lot of tiny little bullish bars a lot of dojis a lot of stems they're just crawling their way higher this is a strong trend don't get confused these strong 90 degree moves higher and big bars they will get rejected and reversed quickly but this is the very strong and healthy trends a lot a lot of small bars doji's and just keep working higher keep working higher so what you have to realize is that during this trade this type of
(08:00) trend you will not get a lot of proper clean second injuries you will just probably be forced to take any pullback you can and it's going to be first entry so the first good setup that i saw was this breakout pullback pattern because you broke this little bit of congestion you pull back and there are two key entry points working in conjunction so this trend line and this support now so you broke and pull back and keep working higher once again you have a attempt to go higher and you can make a case for going along here i'm going to
(08:34) mark it because this is one of those trends that you really have to you know be a little bit more aggressive but and i didn't know if he close higher here if he goes higher here i mean if you trigger higher here then trade it up lower and then trigger higher this would be a second entry but it didn't so yeah this market keeps working higher keeps working higher this is my the first trade that i shared and here's the thing you have a new high right here you have a first century long pull back second entry loan i want to talk about this because when
(09:05) you're watching trend and you don't want to go long at the very high of the move you want to force yourself and keep buying the deep pullbacks the deeper the better you want to buy the corrections that's when the week that's where the weak traders get trapped and smart traders will jump on board and remember trends are designed to look to make counter trend entries looking very nice nice and juicy and look to with trend pullbacks are you know a little bit sketchy so this is how the trends are designed this is why a lot of
(09:39) people are constantly looking for reversing patterns because the traits look so juicy and the bars are looking so nicely but don't fall for this trap you have to buy the pullbacks when it's when it's uncertain because when you wait after the market has proven to that it's resuming it's already too late so this is the second entry long but you're going along at the very high of the day so you have to be cautious of this you have a new high right here percentage along pull back second entry long at the ema first lag pull back second
(10:12) lag this downtrend broke animate a new low so it is safe to look for continuation of an option and prices are still working above the ema so you know you only are looking for a strong or trend for for reasons to go long i already talked about this this was the first break of this bigger pattern so you're looking for prices to make a new high and don't get too you know tricked by this shortened correction working lower just because he broke this channel and we're working lower that's just temporary this is a big big
(10:47) trend up and let the weak traders get trapped and you just wait for nice first century short second entry short hitting move right here and it worked nicely we already made a new high and we keep working higher this week was fantastic hopefully you guys had a great trading week uh we're you know heading into weekend so enjoy the weekend i'm i'm going to wrap it up soon because you probably don't want to hear hear me blabber here so yeah hopefully you guys had a great trading week i'm i'm excited i'm looking forward already
(11:19) to the next week hopefully we're gonna get some nice volatility but don't really worry about the hidden moves but they're there and you can clearly take advantage of this if you're more advanced trader and you know always look just because it's not a perfect second entry there is a two legged move in those trades there is a two-legged pullback hidden there but you know once again i don't take these trades often very rarely because most often than not you want to be looking for the proper technical second entries they're going to be there you
(11:54) know 98 of the time so but just two guys just when i want you guys to know about this so i'm gonna wrap it up and i'm gonna see you guys the next one take care everybody



(270) Explaining The Money Management Strategy - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDhJn3ux30s

Transcript:
(00:00) what is going on traders hopefully you're doing well today i want to talk about something a little bit different because market is very slow because today is the rollover date and generally the second day of the rollover is going to be pretty decent but today is also friday so a lot of traders extended their weekend and there's really nothing much to talk about how to recognize high quality setups how to read the chart correctly so i want to take this opportunity to explain my money management system because i'm getting i'm getting
(00:32) questions almost daily about my risk to reward ratio why i'm going for eight to ten takes when i'm using limit orders so i'm going to div dive into this and by the way this is the september contract is looking very slow and this is the june contract and it's even slower there's really nothing happening so i guarantee a lot of you probably weren't trading today and that was the right thing to do so i want to talk about the importance of having proper money management system because it is crucial it is very very important
(01:02) having the right one because and not only for you know this from the stance of making a lot of money but more importantly it may make making you feel mentally stable and before i dive into this i want to make sure that i don't want to talk bad about anybody because the general consensus is going for four ticks in futures and going for 10 to 10 pips in forex and 10 shares in stocks and i definitely don't have nothing against any trader who have you know different type of money management or risk to reward ratios i
(01:36) respect everybody some of my favorite traders that i learned from are scalping for four ticks but i decided to go for eight to 10 ticks i want to talk about why but before we talk about this we need to talk about the scalping because this is a scalping strategy we are looking for highest probability setups as possible at the key entry points and the goal of scalping is to be very quickly in and out of the market we want to spend as less time in the market have the least exposure as we can but at the same time this is a balance
(02:10) between not leaving a lot of money on a table and not exposing ourselves in the market for a long time because the longer you expose yourself to the markets there's a greater risk of you know you're getting stopped out so we want to be in and out quickly so the professional scalpers goal is to find the right balance between not leaving money on the table and not being long time in the market and that's the great thing about scalping we can make money but the market is selling off rattling up in the trading range we can
(02:38) make money in under any circumstances we are just following professional traders following institutions what they're doing because they're deciding where the market is going to go it's not retail traders make no mistake about it are just you know on you know insignificant traders but we're just following institutions and we don't have to worry about the next day before we wake up when the mark what the market did overnight uh if you're a swing trader not saying the swing trading is wrong but the scalping is a little bit more safer i
(03:06) think if you learn it so i i initially started scalping for four ticks and the reason why i did that because this is the probably the most spread out piece of information between futures traders that you want to scalp s p 500 yes for four ticks you know al brooks talking about it max talking about it a lot of different traders are talking about it as well and since you know 20 30 years everybody has been regurgitating this idea and the reason why i changed it up because in this particular market the stop loss is around a ticks the way you get your
(03:44) stop loss is you backtest the table 30 trades and you put your stop loss one tick below the signal bar and you average the amount of it and in this market is about eight ticks so if i'm having a winning trade and sometimes it's more sometimes less depends on the volatility but what you what used to happen to me i could have one winning trade my one point but if the bar was a little bit bigger let's say three points i just lost a three winning trade on just one loser and i was having you know i was doing pretty good because once i started
(04:16) to learn to read the price section was looking starting to identify the high quality setups i was doing between 60 to 70 but i was still break even and i was constantly questioning myself like what the heck i am i'm 65 and i'm not making any money what is going on here because i know traders who are you know who have 45 win percentage and they have killing money management system and they're really really making a lot of money because they're you know doing good why am i 65 70 and still being you know break even or making some chump change
(04:48) in a few bucks 300 bucks so i decided to switch it up to 8 to 10 ticks and you know the reason is because once i had my you know my loser i knew that right now i find myself in a pit that i need to you know get out of as quick as quickly as i can i right now need to make three winning trades just to be break even and what that would do that would put a lot of pressure on me i would start looking for a lot of trades you know i would start jumping the gun i would be taking a lot of sketchy trades a lot of setup they're not even
(05:24) there they're not at the key entry point those are not second entries high probability setups and that will result as you can expect into even more losing trades so i was really going nowhere i was even more frustrated so i i one day i took a little bit step back and i you know did a little bit introspection and i looked at the chart and i figured out that if i mark the high probability setups if i trade the way i'm supposed to trade if i learn the strategy 98 of those trades would work easily for two points or more easily so i went
(05:56) back i backtest you know 100 days and i figured out that almost you know if you read the chart correctly if you take high probability setups they will work for a lot a lot of points and the reason why traders don't want to why they stick so much to their one point scalp is because they want to be right even if they're wrong even if they're reading the price action wrong in the wrong side of the market they still want to make money i think personally that's a wrong mindset to have because you want to embrace losing trades everybody has
(06:27) losing trades so you want to embrace them and what i used to also do this is a little bit of rent so if you haven't clicked out yet no i appreciate it what i also used to do is i used to scout for two point two ticks two ticks because i wanted to be right so bad and i was so adamant of losing trades that i went for only two ticks obviously that's not going to work at all you can give a six winning trades back when just one one trade plus you will you know give broker all your money on your commissions so that really couldn't work but that's
(07:00) the mindset people don't want to go for more because the longer they are in the trade the more they get frustrated the more they they get scared and they get anxious they they really want to take their money as quickly as they can they cannot stand watching the price go to their target profit and not hit yet they already wanna you know exit the order and take whatever they can because they don't they don't want to have losing trade whatever happens they don't want to have losing trades and that's the wrong business trading is
(07:28) about having losing trades everybody has them i don't care what guru you're watching everybody has losing trades and you need to accept it so since and majority of trades 98 of them would work even for more than four ticks and it is better for your mental state of mind so why not do it because once i go and once i went for eight to ten takes you know i was so in the zone i was feeling comfortable because i know i can make i can make my losing trade right back on the next trade even even win some if i'm going for 10 ticks if the market's a
(08:00) little bit more volatile i can even win a little bit more so i just got really comfortable and you know you know my head was much clearer i was so calm and that resulted in even making more winning trades and i know a lot of you feel the same way because you're thanking me about you know trying this concept and you're seeing that it works so that's the that's my target profit why i'm going for eight to ten takes just because it is better for your bank account and it's better for your mental capital your you really
(08:32) feel so comfortable and once again every every trader is different uh everybody's using different money management system and it works you know you don't have to follow me i'm just getting a lot of questions so i'm explaining what i'm doing now i want to talk about why i'm using limit orders because to me limit orders are just too good not to use them to be honest with you because most of the time market will always always tick one tick below the signal bar or above and then even trace a little bit back very rarely
(09:04) market will gap i don't think let me find a gap between the bar there isn't probably no even not a single gap here very s it's very limited where market just gaps and keeps going and not taking a few ticks back so i'm using the limit orders because one i'm making my risk smaller if i wait for entry to trigger and i put my target lib and put my limit order one or two ticks back my stop loss just got smaller by two takes one two takes and this is good it's making me feel once again more emotionally stable if i have a losing
(09:39) trade i don't worry about it i just saved myself even two ticks so what's the problem what's the matter if i lose here if i can make it back right after the next trade there is no problem whatsoever so that's the one reason the second reason is and this is probably the most important reason institutions are very smart they see the orders and they always go back for the runners you will see that you if you go back and watch my live trading the i will enter a trade prices will go and they will pull back and try to
(10:10) go for all the runners and stop them out if you use limit orders you can actually make your runner a little bit more safe because it's further back and since everybody's using stop orders though prices will go back to their you know break-even point or the interest stop order point and then continue working higher you know i cannot tell you how many runners i have saved by just being a little bit more greedy and put my limit order back you will save and once you get to one or two good runners you know your money management is you know
(10:39) fantastic your your math will come you even completely change the math on your numbers so that's the second reason why i do this and if you think about it if you use if you combine this limit order even with my eight tick authentic target profit it will almost be the same as if you go for four ticks because if you use stop you have to put a one tick above the signal bar and if you put a one tick above the signal bar and let's say you put it one tick above the signal bar and i put a two tick back two ticks back even though i'm going for eight ticks i
(11:15) just self save myself three ticks so you're going for four on a stop and i'm going for eight on the limit order and if you can do the math you know it's a seven to eight and it's very you know similar so yes you will miss some trades that will happen but my personality is okay with this i can handle this i don't worry about this at all because i'll i would rather if i have a losing trade i want to lose as less money as i can and if i have a winning trade i want to really make sure i win so that's my personality i love this i
(11:51) don't worry about missing a trade at all because i know since i'm going for eight to ten ticks i can make my money back i can make a lot of money back fairly quickly because let's say i miss a trade and if i went for four ticks those are two trades so if i miss one trade and then make one trade i still i'm still you know eight ticks in profit so i still made what i would initially on my two on the two trades so you don't have to follow this but this worked for me for many years i've been trading for eight years almost
(12:27) now but we are coming on eight and i've been trading this for like five years let's say i've been first two two and a half three years i've been going for four takes and as i started to get better and better i decided to switch it up and i started to using only limit orders i don't use i very rarely use stop orders i only use stopwaters uh when i'm demonstrating a live trade because i want you guys to see uh my session but i don't really use much top orders limit orders are you know i like limit orders and i'm like 8 to 10 tick target profit
(13:03) so today was a little bit different video uh if you made it to the very end i appreciate it like the video if you get some value from this even though it's just me ranting and subscribe to the channel if you haven't and you know once again i apologize for not really making a good video about the chart but there is really nothing to trade here very slow if you 40 this is one hour before market open market opens right here and this is 16 30 so you've been sitting here for two hours and all this happened and this is a lot of
(13:37) congestion so it's really not not worth to wait so i hope you guys had a great week enjoy your weekend and refresh your mind and i'm gonna see you guys in the on the monday so we can make some money take care everybody




(270) How Can Traders Use Traps To Their Advantage - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2ivxFOJl0U

Transcript:
(00:00) what is going on traders on this channel we talk a lot about high probability setups and those would be our two like a move second entries at the key entry points and doesn't matter whether the key entry point is a trend line support or resistance line or just an exponential moving average the point is when you combine a second entry to like a move with the proper key entry point under the right circumstance it can result into very very high probability setup but there are going to be situations in the market when this
(00:26) very setup will try to trap you in the wrong direction and i'm going to show you guys in this video how to avoid getting trapped all right and i admire two traps that occur on today's chart and what i want to show you guys and what it all comes down to is that both of these setups are two legged moves second entries at the key entry points both of these setups on the first glance look like a high probability setup this is the second entry short at the ema this is the second entry long at the ema so both setups look like
(00:57) they're going to be high probability setups but they're not and why are they not high probably setups well because it all comes down to market context market structure so we're gonna analyze that because when we're starting trading the first thing we have to do is we have to analyze what is the current market structure if we take a look at the yesterday market structure it is pretty obvious to even a novice trader that this is going to be an uptrend prices are making higher highs prices are making higher lows we are above the ema and the trend line
(01:26) is holding prices nicely this is a clearly and strong uptrend today however it didn't start this way we have leg down leg up like down leg up leg down leg up so this is a clearly a trading range so i'm keeping in the back of my mind i'm probably going to have to trade this as a trading range you know for the majority of the time unless we burst out the breakout and go into a trend which i don't know that's going to happen so i'm going to what i'm going to do i'm going to buy the lows and sell the highs so i'm going to draw my support and my
(01:59) resistance line and you guys can see this is a clearly and trading range where swinging up and down in the ema is in the middle of those bars there's no clear strength trend up no clear trend down now what i'm also going to do is i'm going to draw my trend line so that i can safely navigate to this key entry point and i can safely predict what where is going to be a high probability setup so that's what i'm doing i have a break and a new high so it's the rule of the trend line after break of a trend line traders will attempt to make a new
(02:26) extreme and i have this downstream working lower i have a break and now i'm expecting for prices to make a new low correct yes that is correct but remember overall market structure is trading range and the way you trade trading range is you buy the lows you sell the highs or you fade the breakout if you have a good signal bar so we have a new law right here we have a first century short pullback second entry short but why don't we want to take this second entry short even though it is off strong key entry point of the ema
(02:57) well because the market context is a trading range and we just broke lower and most breakouts of trading edges will fail and we're coming off the lows and when you're coming off the lows of the trading range you're most likely heading to the other side so this trap first entry short second entry short failure is actually a good high probability setup in itself this would be called a failed second entry so this is high probability setup second entry in entrend and a counter trend trend high quality setup is a failed second entry
(03:26) now here's the second trap and guys remember the trap looks like a second entry it needs to lure traders in this for example this is not a trap because nobody's going to go long on a first entry in a downtrend under the ema this will not trap a lot of people the whole idea behind traps is that trap will lure a lot of traders in because a lot of traders trade price action as well so they will lower a lot of traders in who don't really you know want to analyze the proper market context so this would be the second trap for the
(03:59) day first century long pull back second and too long at the ema but what was wrong here so first since i'm already playing the trading range rules and i'm drawing my shortened trend lines i'm going to draw my shortened trend line here as well you guys can see this is a nice channel that is working higher we have a break and we have a 2x the new high now i can also measure this first lag copy it put it to the here and i have a second lag almost perfect measured move to the very take first leg pull back second leg so after i see this two leg
(04:32) move up and i see that prices broke the trend line and created a new high i'm no longer expecting any more pushes higher plus most breakouts of trading ranges will fail and if you have a good signal bar you want to fade a breakout or you want to wait for a lower high so i know that this is a trading range and most breakouts will fail so i'm not interested in taking setup above the failed breakout above the trading range about the resistance because prices will most likely pull back so this second entry long is a trap
(05:04) because two-legged move up happen and we have a break and a new high so this would be a good entry to go short on because this is all with what you would see this is still looking very choppy this is not looking like a very strong trend these are just two legs up and you're expecting for prices to reach down here now i am going to mark this setup this second entry long at the ema as a high probability setup and you may be wondering tom why did you mark this second entry long and this second entry long is a trap and
(05:34) this is okay well that's a good question i'm gonna explain to you guys in a minute once prices will break the trend line and they will make a new extreme what's going to happen next well according to rules prices may straight up reverse or they will go into correction and this is what happened right here prices tried to reverse the market but it didn't happen and it ended up correcting we ended up being in this correction for almost 30 minutes so after breaking a new high prices will straight up reverse or go into correction in this case
(06:03) there was the correction period now since this is a trading range i'm expecting for prices to push the market lower because i don't know that these prices will resume in an uptrend there is no way for me to know so what i'm looking at is i'm looking for the first lag first attempt to pull the market lower pull back and this is the second attempt to pull the market lower and both times the bears are failing and it is indicating to me that there's a lot of buyers at this support it previously acted as a resistance and now the side
(06:35) switched and it acts as a support first lag second lag both two attempts failed to drag the market lower we didn't even make it to the middle of trading range this tells you that there's a lot of strong buying momentum in the market a lot of people are willing to go long so after this correction period when you have these three big bullish bars this indicates you that the trend will resume and i'm gonna confuse you even a little bit more but but don't worry it's going to be okay that in my video about tips about trend lines i specifically
(07:09) mentioned that the bigger patterns take more time to develop what you don't want to do you don't want to draw your trend line something like this or something like this because this is not how really market operates i explained when you're looking for a bigger pattern you need to give market a little bit more room and let it breathe to make and show you what's the bigger pattern is it for a bigger pattern to develop and this is exactly what the correction surf so far this correction served just to make this bigger pattern
(07:39) more visible now there is no way for us to go long here because this would just set up the trend line we have no prior reference to anything this is just the first load the market would confirm this trend but the point here is that this trade is okay because right now the bigger pattern was established but this trait was not okay because the shortened pattern played out and there is not enough room for me to look for a bigger pattern so hopefully you guys are not too confused about this and you have a break of this upper trend line
(08:10) working higher and attempt to make a new extreme overall once again it is a friday and it has been a very slow day but i specifically wanted to talk about these two traps because that's what trap look like looks like trap is just a second entry high probability set up at the key entry point but the thing here that is different is the market context it had you have to analyze the entire market structure what is happening before you pull the trigger i'm going to wrap the video and make sure you study your charts over the
(08:41) weekend and i'm gonna see you guys in the next one take care everybody




(270) So You Are Still Moving Your Stop Loss - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdgvwfhWhHU

Transcript:
(00:00) let me pitch a scenario for you so we've been trading for quite some time you've been watching all the videos reading all the books and you finally found a strategy that you're willing to follow and you want to give it a shot so okay thomas second entries at the key entry point so i'm going to give it a try there it is first lag second lag second entry long double bottom but it's still too early this is pre-market open session so the market goes without you market pulls back first century short second entry short
(00:26) triple bottom reversal pattern high probability setup but this is still too early you're not trading so the market goes without you again you'll start trading somewhere around here and the market is consolidating and there it is first century long second inch long two like a pullback nice setup but you will not take this trade because market is below ema and it's looking a little bit too bearish so what you're gonna do you're gonna sit on your hands and you're gonna wait but there it is first century short second entry short
(00:53) reversal pattern this is where i'm gonna go long here i'm waiting for a new high so this is what i'm going to go owing so i'm going to put my limit order in and this happens wait what is this oh hold on whoa what is this this is not what i signed up for oh oh it's a losing trade okay okay i must be really unlucky then i must be i must be the unluckiest trader ever because i've missed all these good trades and suddenly i take this trade it is instantly a losing trade you know that's not fair how is this fair and i know i guarantee you some of you
(01:23) felt like this at some point in your trading career and this is wrong we need to accept the fact that trading and everybody has losing trades in trading loving losing trades is the most natural thing there is in trading losing trades are like business expenses if we want to be available for to the market to make winning trades we also need to you know accept the fact that they are going to be losing trades and so many people still don't truly accept the fact that the market may not go in their favor and how do we know that
(01:55) they do not accept this fact but first of all they try to put as many indicators as they can on the chart to eliminate the risk of you know having a losing trade they want to find so many variables to filter the losing trades and it's not going to happen but they also what they do they also move their stop-loss when a professional trader enters the trade he will put his stop-loss where it belongs where he analyzed this and we put his tiger profit and what he he will not no longer worry about how the trade will you know pan out because we can no
(02:24) longer do anything about this only thing we can do is manage our stop loss and manage our target profit we have no control over whether mark is going to go up or going to go down so we just have to watch the market and not monkey with our trades but a lot of traders still move their stop loss and why do they move a stop loss because they didn't accept the risk you know they think they do what because they put their stop loss on the chart where it belongs because since we start trading everybody drills it into our heads
(02:52) that you need to put your stop loss and to your target profit where it belongs blah blah blah but it doesn't mean we truly accept the risk that the trade male fail on us so they move their stop loss because they want to have as little losing trade as possible because they judge their performance on the one singular trade and this is wrong you know one single trade has no meaning what carries all the meaning is a big picture i like to compare to boxing trading is like boxing i don't care who you are even if you're someone as good
(03:21) as floyd mayweather even floyd mayweather got hit plenty of times in the boxing but he ended up on top at the end of the day and this is exactly how we need to judge our trading performance we need to judge it not even at the end of the day at the end of the week and possibly at the end of the month because you can have two bad winning trades in two bed winning days in a row but still have a fantastic week so we don't care about one singular trade we you cannot feel threatened when you're trading and a lot of traders do they when they
(03:55) put their trade into the market they feel threatened they feel these jitters you know because they don't want to lose the money they've been you know analyzing so much they've been working so hard so they want to do anything they can to not having a losing trade but that's not the proper mindset if you're a professional trader you're confident you're calm you're flowing i know i guarantee a lot of you experience this where you have three or four winning trades in a row you feel so good you feel like you know what the mark is going to do next you
(04:22) can't really accept this but you know what's most likely going to happen next and this is the you know state of mind that you want to get into but in order for you to achieve the state of mind you really have to create the ability not caring and not being threatened by the market because when you're not threatened when you're not threatened by the market you don't need to be you don't have to have nerves of steel why would you have to have nerves of steel if you're not threatened by the market you're not stressed out you're not
(04:52) you know you're not worried about anything you're just going you're just tracking you're just trading taking the trades and i'm going to give you guys a tip that i had to do when i was struggling with moving my stop-loss is and i i know a lot of you are still struggling with with this during this day day because a lot of you are going from four ticks to eight ticks and a lot of you are messaging me and saying that when i see my uh prices reaching my 40 target you know i already want to take the money and go out because i still have to sit in this
(05:26) trade and i still have to over analyze and overthink because i'm still waiting for market to reach the eight digs and this is telling you something about you this is telling you that you you know you're still feeling nervous you still threatened because why would you worry about these things if you truly accept the fact that you have no more no control over this you know you enter your trade and only thing you do is wait if other traders have the same intentions there's there's nothing to influence there's nothing to you know manipulate we can no
(05:54) we cannot do anything so what i did is i learned to put my target put my limit order and put this you know put my stop loss where it belongs put my target profit button belongs and i alt tap and i wouldn't look at the chart and initially i felt the need you know every 10 seconds i wanted to look back all step back into the trading software and see how my trade is going you know should i really checking out this trades should i exit early should i move my stop-loss should i move my target profit because i was still you know
(06:25) in you know too much in my head you know over analyzing everything but once i learn to really put my limit order where it belongs put my target profit and sell stuff where it belongs and then not watch the market for 15 minutes this will really train you not caring about the one singular trade because remember we don't care about one singular setup all we care about is the major of the multiple of setups that we take during the day so you put your you take the trade put everything where it belongs and then you stop watching the trade you
(06:57) don't care it works great or it fails doesn't matter it is a trade you did everything you could and after the trades play out you know you keep analyzing the chart and you take another trade and you you do the same thing you stop looking at the chart and you will feel the need to look back trust me most people most traders they can't you know enter the trade and stop looking at the trade how the trade is paying out they they just can't do it so you really need to and once you master this skill you will really not care about the
(07:30) outcome of this trade and why am i telling you this well this is because this is what the trader messaged me today and this was his you know thought process and i told him basically what i um explained in this video so i'm hoping that the trader can learn from this this is just a constructive criticism because i know so many traders go through this i went through the same thing myself when i was starting out so you know we really have to not caring when we're trading about the outcome of just one single trade
(08:03) but with my rent being over today structure was looking very very slow and it's not surprising because we're heading into an extended weekend and a lot of traders are already out there taking their vacations so the market was really slow and for the majority of the session markets was just chopping like this so there are nice uh high priority setups right here but this is two early pre-market open session so this is a shame that we have to trade when the market is something like here but remember guys first thing we want to do identify the
(08:34) structure we have a triple bottom clearly this is looking like a trading range so far but you guys can see that we're trying to trend higher and we actually ended up working higher we have a higher highs higher lows so this is starting to look like an uptrend so you have to do you have to draw the shortened trend line like this and there is an overshoot what you can even do is you can make it a two-tiered channel this is a possibility as well i'm gonna delete this because i wanna guys clearly to see those two lags there's
(09:01) the new high first century long pullback second entry long now look at this double double bottom right here we just made a triple bottom right here and we the resistance here is forming you guys can see that we are going sideways for the most part we're not going higher we're not going lower second entry long you have a break and a new low this is the first break of this uptrend so according to our rules we are expecting a new extreme this was the trade that the trader took and to be honest with you it's not a bad
(09:29) trade at all first century short second entry short you're waiting for a new high only thing this is very tempting trade if you look at the right side of the chart this is looking very tempting you're looking for a new high the only thing that would help you here by the time you enter you have one two three four bars going sideways and look how ema is in the middle of those bars nothing really happened inside of these four bars we're going up down up down so the price stayed the same so you guys can see how the ema is
(09:58) exactly in the middle of those bars and you're located in the middle of this trading range you may not even see this trading range yet but you can see that this is a smaller congestion nevertheless i will give it the pass that according to our strategy this would be a good trade and this would result into losing trade market made a quadruple bottom right here and then reversed and then we just went into this horrible horrible choppy mess and the thing you need to do when you see a lot of bars going sideways and a
(10:27) lot of stems you just have to see on your hands there's no other way around it it is tempting i know how tempting it is to see all these stems and to be just selling or buying but when the day is slow like this and it's friday the best thing you should do is probably sit on your hands and not trade or even you know close the shop and go home and look how it ended up rallying unfortunately there are no setups the last setup there is and you guys can see we traded up higher into the trading range so what's most likely going to happen
(10:55) you're going to break higher and as we are breaking up higher you're expecting some sort of bigger pattern because you have a setup like this you're going sideways and you have like this so you know there's most likely going to be some sort of trend line something like this and once you're breaking up higher you can find a potential trend line so this is how i would be looking and eyeballing the trend line if it's nicely off the tops very nicely we are above the ema so uptrend is now clearly visible so we're looking only
(11:22) for reasons to go long this is the new high and notice how we didn't break about this bar so the first entry trigger on this bar pull back pull back pull back first entry because we didn't trigger above this bullish bar we triggered above this bearish bar one take pull back second entry long ema's holding prices nice bullish bar resulted in a winner i don't think anybody would be trading you know on the friday late like this but i probably set up simple price action there it is and as you are heading into an extended weekend
(11:57) what i want you to do is to study your chart and to journal your trades because it will really help you just make sure you go back and you know learn from your winning trades learn from your losing trades you know over the weekend because you have to be better than your competition i know i i will be personally studying during the weekend the charts uh learning from my mistakes because you still have to do it and this is never ending process if you think you're gonna learn trading in one or two years and then never do the work no you always have to
(12:27) do the work you always have to grind and you always have to keep working and analyzing your chart as well as working on your mental side of trading so this video was a little bit unorthodox a little bit different but i wanted to talk about this because the market is was really weird today there were really not that many setups this setup would be good if the signal bar was slightly better you can make a case for going along here as an aggressive trader but it has a bearish body so i wasn't too excited about this
(12:58) and to be honest i didn't take any trade today i just sit on my hands because the market was so choppy i just stood in my hands and watched this and i was answering emails and doing other stuff but you know hard hard day to trade to be honest one was worth worst days that we had but enjoy the weekend there is no video on monday most likely unless i will come up with something but there's definitely no live trading because uh the market is going to be closed so you know enjoy the weekend take care everybody




(270) How to Use Multiple Time Frames to Filter The BEST Trades - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEYG2Kptufk

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on traders so i thought of you guys a few tips on how to analyze the chart better using multiple time frames and this is 2 000 tick chart i'm just going to start by saying that the tick charts allow us to see prices in much more detail this is why i really love using tick charts because this is really raw unfiltered data as what the institutions are doing we're just following these big players hedge funds institutions they are the ones who are creating the big moves so we're just following them so we naturally want to
(00:30) have and we naturally want to gather as much details as we can but on the time based charts and i'm going to pull you for you guys a five minute charts right here on a time based chart every single every single five minutes there has to be a candle plotted on this five-minute chart and what you will end up is with you will end up with consolidation like this the prices are really not going anywhere because there's very few orders coming into the market and but the bar has to be plotted it has to be plotted every five minutes
(01:00) but this won't happen on tick chart tick chart will filter these congestions there will be only one or two or three bars so tick charts are really reliable in that sense but you know enough for me rambling let's go to the tips on how i today use five minute charts to filter the good trades the day started with the strong uptrend working higher we pushed through ema we have a two legged pullback to the ema and a two legs to a new high so according to trendline was this straight this trend played out then we pushed below ema after the new
(01:32) extreme i'm expecting either straight up reversal or possibly correction so we're pushing below ema there's a change in behavior but hold on i don't want to sell you just yet because i want to sell on a high probability reversal pattern and the reversal pattern is characterized by two felt attempts in the previous trans direction previous trend was bullish so what i want to see i want to see felt second entry long below ema ema holding prices and then i want to go short that didn't happen right here so i just have to sit on my
(02:03) hands because right now we're chopping up and down up and down and it's fairly confusing so this is a correction phase then price is made first like two new high pullback second leg to new high and is a felt break higher above this resistance so even on this chart there's enough information for me to gather this is a failed breakout but it didn't look like that to me i made a mistake here a little bit and especially to novice trader to novice trader this can look like a trend is resuming and it looked a little bit like that to
(02:32) me and you guys going to see in the second part of video my live trading today what i did so hopefully that will be useful as well but i like putting limit order on this trade and why did i like putting limiter on this trade well this is a first century short second entry short breakout pullback and prices are now holding on the support but i quickly canceled the limit order why did i cancel the limit order well the reason is simple is because of what happened right here this is a five minute chart we have a spike and a channel working
(02:59) higher this is a legit pattern trend line fitting perfectly but on a five minute chart we have a break and a clear like the new extreme so on five minute chart the uptrend played out so there is no reason for me to continue going higher at the very height of the day but it's just a first entry after two measured legs higher the uptrend depleted by the time you get second entry you're going along at the very high of the move so you're breaking above the resistance so as you know most breakouts will fail this is a second entry long trap and a
(03:31) good setup to go short i didn't enter short here because i was a little bit thinking long i quickly cancel the limit order and this setup too quickly so i didn't enter here but since i already know that on a five minute chart we have a break and a new high you know what's going to happen correction or straight up reversal so on a 2 000 tick chart we're pushing lower we're pushing below ema strongly and a reversal pattern is starting to happen we have a new right here first century short second entry short it's a high quality setup it is at the
(04:00) ema at the key entry point big bearish bar this is a breakout pullback of this resistance this is my first trade for the day quick easy scalp my runner got stopped out and here was my second trade for the day i fortunately i got too greedy even after eight years of trading you can still make a lot of emotional mistakes because i had a fairly good winning streak i felt too invincible and i paid the price for it i was thinking to go long here but i made a crucial mistake here because you have a first century short
(04:30) second entry short right here but you don't want to go long to this trend line at the very end of the move when you're away from the ema so i treat it as a failed second entry short right here but you're below ema you want to see change in behavior that a lot of people are willing to buy with me and the ema should be holding prices there should be nice polish bar at the ema but instead we close lower and they trap me in plus you're working lower of this downtrend you have a break and you're expecting a new extreme so there is no surprise i
(04:59) get trapped here there is no high priority setup just my mental mistake prices just turned on working lower we are just now making second lag to this low of the day and i cannot stress it enough i do it you know every single time before i start my live trading videos i analyze the lows i analyze the highs and i identify the market structure prior my entrance i do this because more often than not these lows or highs for the day they will come into play and they'll be strong key levels for today and they happen right here
(05:31) so as you guys will see in my video in the second part my live trading i try to buy this bar and this bar but we didn't trigger higher one tick about this bar so the entry didn't occur so i canceled every order and prices pushed lower well what i see i see uptrend and i see downtrend this is a trading range this is a clear trading range whoops strong support right here so we have a felt brake lower and i keep preaching how majority of these breakouts will fail so what i did since you have such a failed breakout i put my limit order in
(06:05) right here but it's not enough as soon as you're talking about multiple time frames look what happened on the 5-minute chart by the time i was entering the bar was forming somewhere around here and what does this mean if you take a look when i was looking at the time we were so far away from ema this is a 90 degree move down very steep and as i keep going and as i keep killing and telling you guys prices will not stay a long time away from ema ema acts as a magnet and it will pull prices closer to it so not only we have a field break lower
(06:38) and you're far away from ema even here but especially on a five minute chart you're really really far away i put my limit router in exactly at the close and it didn't get filled and what a bummer i kicked myself afterwards hard because this is i probably would have exited right here 22 points because the way i play runners is i trail the stop loss below each new swing let's say something like here so it would be disingenuous to claim i would milk it all the way up that wouldn't happen most likely i would got stopped
(07:09) right here but still 22 points on one single contract this is why you wanna when you fake the breakouts you wanna always hold a runner because you can catch a low of the day or high of the day majority of the times and just 22 points on one single contract is that if that's not enough motivation for you guys to keep trading working hard you can make a average person salary on one single contract that's fabulous but i missed the trade unfortunately and i really kicked myself afterwards but what is happening right
(07:37) here is very similar to what happened right here fail break higher push below ema second entry short at the ema you push lower you push above the ema in the first century long second entry long at the ema but not only that not only we have a second entry long which is high quality setup we also have a trap traders who are not really understanding the structure that is changing we have a fail break lower downtrend played out they still want to jump on the train way too late because you're pushing above this support now above this ema any first
(08:08) century short second entry short confluence ema is holding prices i didn't announce this bar because this is a way too big bar and the risk would be way too big and after that i just got fed up and i stopped trading so i was a break even or even lose lost this few bucks here but gorgeous trade right here and i marked another trade two felt attempts to go lower off the ema off the trend line the bar is unentrable i marked it for educational purposes only because next time you see this the bar is smaller this is where you want to
(08:38) enter this bar is way too big and look at it go gorgeous bar you have a break new high perfect price action and that brings me up to um to this time based chart because people are asking me whether this price action trading works on other commodities tax forex and you know time frames price action works on every single time frame and chart this is a five minute chart you guys can see spike in the channel nicely fits nicely over breaking a new high you have a trendline working over break attempt to make a new low trend line
(09:08) working over break attempt to make a new low it's okay that you don't have a new low because that's the whole point behind this strong key entry point key entry point is so strong it only created a double bottom you have a first century long second entry long first century long second entry loan prices you know act this way on all time frames because it's tied down to human psychology this is the magic behind trading technical analysis patterns they repeat over and over not every single time but you know with statistical reliability and i also want
(09:38) to elaborate on two trades that i took yesterday because this is a strong downtrend prices are below ema and this is the second entry short at the ema second entry short at the ema but as i was looking at the five minute chart this was the first trade this was the second trade on a five minute chart i can see confirmation of a bearish bar of this trend line so okay good it doesn't matter we are not close to the ema because i'm only looking for quick easy scalp that's the you know amazing thing about this stretch we only care about quick easy 10
(10:10) 8 to 10 ticks just to be quickly in and out of the market so i don't care we're a little bit away from the ema i just need to see bearish bar at the trend line because had the my entry bin at this bullish bar far away from trend line i would probably hesitate to take this because market may reverse but this was the reason why i'm you know this is a little bit the reason how i'm using the five-minute chart but i really want to end up with this before i show you guys my live trading today you really don't want to get too
(10:39) confused with multiple time frames what you want to do especially if you're beginning trader you want to pick one pick one chart one time frame and master this you want to become proficient and trading one single chart because every single you know chart commodities tax forex every single chart has its own tendencies and you really want to become master at one you really want to know the chart at the back of your hand that's what most professionals do they really only study strongly one chart so this is what really you want to do i use it just as a
(11:08) supportive tool just to get me a little bit of edge but i take all my trades and i make all my analysis on one single chart so this is just for you guys who are a little bit too you know want to see a little bit more advanced stuff how i analyze but still i you know everything is right here on this one single chart so i'm going to play the live video hopefully you guys will enjoy it and find it useful what i saw how i drew the trend lines and if you made it to this part of the video and you find it useful please hit the like button subscribe to

(270) What People Won't Tell You About Day Trading - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYI4QLdhsAU

Transcript:
(00:00) so what nobody talks about when it comes to  reality of trading is what the trading is truly about because when people show you the trading  lifestyle all you see the flashy lamborghinis you see the five different monitors you see the  trading different instruments it's all action it's all fun it's all exciting but the reality to  making a trading for a living couldn't be further from the truth because when you're being a trader  you have to have a set of strategy that you follow you have to have a rules that you follow that  you stick to you have to know the time frame
(00:28) and the good setups may appear when the bad setups  probably will appear and you need to follow this to the t but there are going to be days where  the market and trading is going to be extremely extremely boring and you have to be content with  this this comes with the territory and you sign up for it you want to be financially free you want to  be your own boss so you have to take the good with the good you have to take the bad with the bad and  some days the setup is just not going to be there or you will miss the setup and this is exactly  what happened to me today today i was trading
(00:59) for four hours and i didn't take a single  set up i missed two trades and this will happen you will turn your head and boom good high  probability setup will just pass by you you will miss it and you have to be okay with this you  cannot get mad you cannot start revenge trading you cannot take the trades they're not really  there they're just developing but you want to pay the bills you want to make the money if you  want to create a consistently rising equity curve you need to follow and stick to your  rules because the high priority setups
(01:29) are you know quite rare if every trade every five  minutes there will be a high probability set up we all would be rich so when you're waiting for  the proper setup you really have to be patient and you really have to stick to your guts guns  to be consistently profitable and today i missed the two trades and i didn't make any money and  that's okay with me because not making money is better trust me it's much better than losing  money not making money is like putting money in the bank so it's okay to end on a zero then to  end red because tomorrow is always not a day
(02:00) and there are going to be days where there are  going to be a lot of setups and you will just making the money quickly so this is what we're  going to talk about today i want to show you guys in the second part of the video my live trading  today even though it's not really eventful because i didn't take no trades but i still want you guys  to see how i draw the trend lines how i look for setups i really want you to see how it was just  not taking a trade because that's the foundation of trading really being patient that's the name of  the game that's what it all comes down to so let's
(02:28) dive into charts so when we're looking for high  probability setups what we are basically looking for is a second entry at the key entry point  and the first thing we have to do is we have to analyze the current market structure and  today started with a little bit of a sell-off we have a break and a new low you always want to  try to draw the shortened trend lines and even the bigger trend lines because you want to see where  the break is and where the new extreme is most likely going to be and prices created a double  bottom and then pushed strongly above the ema
(02:57) and created reversal pattern first century short  pullback second entry short ema's holding prices this is a strong reversal pattern and prices from  that point on related off higher and prices are making higher highs higher lows so what you have  to do is you have to find a trend line and when i was trading live i was looking for a bigger  trend line and i really couldn't make it fit and no matter where i put it and looking back i  unfortunately miss this trend line which is very nice and fits prices nicely so this is the nice  valid trend line and this is where you would be
(03:31) looking for high probability setups at the key  entry point either right here or at the ema and lower behold we have a new high right here first  century long pullback second entry long is a two legged move at the key entry point this would be  a good high probability setup once again i missed this trade unfortunately because i was trading the  bigger channel and we were quite away from the ema so i wasn't really paying too much attention  to this setup but i ended up having the channel wrong and even that can happen sometimes you  have a break attempt to make a new high and
(04:02) this can sometimes happen too sometimes you  will just get a double top or double bottom as an attempt by the traders to make a new  extreme and a lot of times that will be enough so what we have a break and attempt to make a  new high double top prices started to pushing below ema and what you should be looking for is  basically the same thing that happened right here a reversal pattern so we have a new high right  here first century long pullback second entry long failure but the failure triggered one tick below  a bullish bar and we're going short we are selling
(04:32) so we want to see a trigger below this parish bar  you can't enter below this bullish bar you have to enter below this bearish bar and unfortunately we  didn't get the trigger this would be a setup that i was waiting to jump on but we didn't get the  trigger and you just have to sit on your hands and prices found support at the ema we created  a lower high double top right here and here was the first trade that i missed for today the re i  was trying to sneak in a little bit further back one take i played it too safe and i played it  too safe because we didn't trigger below this
(05:05) signal bar the following bar traded up higher and  that's why i was a little bit too leery because it started to look a little bit congested like but  once i saw prices are pushing lower i instantly put it at the close where i normally put it  unfortunately i got left behind and you have a break and a new low from here but this right here  was a good trade bill ema and you're still waiting for a new low of this trend line and the market is  reversing because we have a break and a new high now we have a second entry short of the ema right  here but what you're watching is is already you
(05:35) have a break and a new low so i don't think you  want to take the second entry short because you don't know you're going to continue working  lower you have no idea from this point on so you just have to be patient market pushes  higher and makes a lower high setup big nice reversal bearish bar that close below ema notice  the stim at the upper half of the body upper third because everybody was buying at the very end of  the bar everybody's starting selling so this is exactly what you want to see when you're trying  to sell and there is a resistance forming so this
(06:07) is where i attempted to short as well but once  i saw this gap you guys can see there is a gap between the bars we didn't even trigger one tick  further back we just started at the close and instantly sold off lower i don't know why was i  thinking that but i just knew i was gonna you know get left behind here because when you have a gap  like here and you instantly started selling off i was hoping for prices to pull back but that  didn't happen market just went out without me and that was already uh pretty uh stressful to  be honest because i missed two trades that were
(06:40) according to rules and a good trades and i've been  trading for quite some time i'll be trading for an hour at this point on and market continue working  lower you have a second entry show right here but you don't really know that there is  a bigger downtrend working it ended up and what i was looking at initially was something  like this trying to find oops trying to find it off the lows copy it put it to the top and you  have a break and multiple new lows but as we kept overshooting the market i don't think this is  too valid it really doesn't matter because once
(07:14) the market keeps selling off you really only  want to wait for second entries at the key entry point with the trend a lot of times this  big sell-off will continue much lower to the open of the day which actually i don't have  this drawn but you guys can see the low of the day is important it will come into play at some  point throughout the day and we actually have a first entry short pullback second entry short  of the trend line so i'm going to mark this setup even though it's a little bit further away  from ema but i like how it's a lower high setup
(07:49) and you trap everybody going along  here and then instantly turn back down so this is once again a high probability setup  second entry of the key entry point and you have to you know if you don't get into this trade  you just have to watch the market go without you but from this point i was already done with  trading and i didn't make any money and that's okay because you know like i said not making money  is better than losing money and that's part of this game you just have to be patient there is no  other way around it and you cannot you know jump
(08:17) the gun you cannot get into if he trades so that  comes into territory from that point on you have a break in a new low you're finding the support  at the very low of the day approximately and prices push strongly about the ema right here and  this is a good indication the prices are starting to reverse that balls are jumping into the  market and there are no second entries at the key entry point you have a first century long  pullback second entry long but you're going along at the very high of this move you have a break  in a new high almost you're far away from ema
(08:46) so you don't want to take a chance  going along at this high right here once prices make a pullback lower this will serve  to make a trend line and trendline got confirmed right here and here would be a good failed second  entry show this is the new low price is once again pushed and confirmed we're pushing strongly  above the ema and you have this big bullish bar but you're going along actually let me see this  is actually i thought this is just a first entry but now that i'm looking at there's this doji bar  that i missed technically there's a first entry
(09:19) short the failed and a second entry short  so i have to mark this like i said i wasn't trading at this point on so this part of chart is  already hindsight but i i didn't really call this uh i really noticed this because i  thought this is just a first entry but technically this is a first entry  short because we trigger build this bar instantly failed and a second entry  short failure big bullish bar off the ema so this is a good bar because i was looking at the  felt second entry short somewhere around here and
(09:47) you definitely don't want to go long at the very  high of the move already after you move this far and prices turn down higher and you're still  inside of this uptrend so you should be only thinking to go long you have a new high right  here pull back first century long pull back second entry long your entry would be one tick or at the  close of this inside bar and your stop still would have survived because we want to put your stop  loss one tick below the signal bar this is you use the price action structure to help you protect  the stop and you will get additional higher low
(10:19) uh setup that you could add on even though only  advanced traders should should add on but you can add on even on this trade high low setup still  confirmation of the trend line and it resulted into quick easy scalp so remember guys there are  going to be days that are going to be extremely boring and you just have to follow your rules and  trust the process so i'll see you guys next time so my
(11:33) so so so so

(270) How To Trade Market Trendline Imbalance - Overshoot - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCeNTRKpe9s

Transcript:
(00:00) as a price action traders we use trend lines and trend channel lines to help us identify the market structure and to help us find high probability setups according to price action rules after trendline will break prices most often than not will re-test the new extreme but what do we do when we see an overshoot of a trendline something like this this is what we're going to talk about in today's video so the first thing we need to understand when we talk about overshoots is that overshoot is very unnatural activity in the market
(00:31) because market geometry is a real thing there is a rhyme and reason why market moves and technical analysis works and patterns repeat over and over again and when we see overshoot this indicates to us that the market is very overbought now i'm very hesitant to using this term overbought because a lot of people will now put rsi on a chart and you know stochastics and a lot of indicators trust me you don't need this the price action on the chart alone will tell you everything you need to know you don't have to complicate your life
(01:02) just look at the chart and read the price section and you will see all the information that there is provided to you when we see overshoot we need to understand the overshoot most often than not will lead to break over trend line and sometimes even straight up reversal so you need to be extremely cautious when you see a setup bouncing off the trend line which under the right circumstances would be a high probability setup but because of the overshoot it can be trapped and don't worry guys i've prepared tons of examples for you
(01:31) to really sink it in and for you to really understand how overshoots look and how to trade them so we are at example number one this is a clear downtrend we have a first swing right here second swing right here that set the trend line up and the third swing confirm the trend line there's no denying that this is a valid two tier channel working lower and this is a strong downtrend and we are working below ema but notice what happened strong steep move down this is a strong oversold condition in the market notice how far away you're
(02:03) getting from the ema this is a good sign of overshoot as well because as you know ama pulls prices closer to it it acts as a magnet so when you see prices working away from the ema for a long period of time that's not long term sustainable and price will snap back now this is a strong steep overshoot and look what it led to we have a break of this trend line and price didn't even attempt to make a new extreme we straight up reversed this is what happens when you have an overshoot so when you have a bounce off trend line
(02:31) right here you want to skip this anyway you want to let this correction play out just to be safe example number two strong downtrend a lot of confirmations of this channel really strong channel working lower and there's a lot of high probabilities set up on its way down and here we have a overshoot four big bearish bar consecutive last bearish attempt and this is a depletion move and we are far away from ema and prices broke the trend line eventually here we have a one more bounce of trend line this is just a first entry so we don't
(03:03) want to take this anyway but you still want to be careful and you still don't want to take this trade because look it's not too long from the prices actually ended up reversing and never looking back so just because you have a little bit of a consolidation and it took some time that don't mean that you want to you know take this set up you just want to be careful expect a break or possibly straight up reversal just let the bullish correction in this instance play out example number three nice bearish downtrend confirmed this
(03:33) one is a smaller one but it all acts the same this is a clearly downtrend and we have an overshoot right here you're not that far away from ema but you're getting further far away from ema big bearish bar bars and notice you have a first entry short second entry show two like a pullback at the ema and at the key entry point trend line this trade still would have worked i already checked it 33 19 75 33 17 75 this still would have worked for a tick scalp scalpel's profit but it just you know few seconds later we ended up
(04:06) breaking the trend line so because overshoot a lot of times break the trend line and we ended up making a new extreme in this instance which is good but this would not be an ideal trade because we have overshoot if the overshoot weren't here and we bounce much sooner of this lower downtrend this would be a great high probability setup example number four a massive strong downtrend working lower this overshoot happened on a much bigger picture but it still applies the same a lot of consecutive bearish bars big bars so far away from ema and look
(04:41) what it led to eventually breaking the channel and going into the next day and we have a setup of this downtrend it still once again would have worked for scalp but look what it led to it just this is a strong bullish trend right now from the oversold condition and this is what we should a lot of times do so when you see overshoot trust me you want to pay attention to this uptrend right now another example price is working lower clear downtrend below the ema and at the very end of the move we have a big bearish bar
(05:11) depletion candle overshoot we're getting far away from ema and lord behold it led to break of a trendline and ended up reversing and we didn't even look back yeah we ended up going in the opposite direction once again overshoot right here you can argue that we have a break of the trend line which will a lot of times lead to making a new low but this break happened in the overnight session a lot of times breaks in the overnight session will not count because the traders are still not trading the regular u.s hours
(05:40) and because nothing is written in stone when it comes to trading here we have an overshoot which took a little bit of time to break the trend line price is overshot the upper trend line right here this is a strong bullish move up we're far away from ema we pull back close to ema you still don't want to take this trade because you're expecting for prices to break the trend line it didn't happen this is one of those cases one out of 10 times we actually ended up working higher then we have a break and clear attempt to new new high before
(06:09) the market consolidated so this is just a little bit different situation but still the rules apply the same you want to be extra cautious when you see overshoot and when you're taking the setup off the trendline now here we have seventh example nice uptrend it you know prices are fitting nicely inside of this channel we have a strong bullish move up a little bit overshoot but then we have a confirmation of this overshoot we're so far away from ema you're going to pull back market is very overbought and what it led to
(06:37) break of a trend line and second leg down we ended up making a new high at the end of the day but the shortened aspect broke the trend line classic overshoot one more example clear downtrend it fits prices nicely we have an overshoot at the bottom we're getting away from the ema big bearish bar depletion last bearish attempt we're pulling back to ema and prices eventually broke the trend line and they ended up creating a new extreme which is good but you always want to pay respect this uptrend which happened from the
(07:11) oversold condition and here's my last example that i have prepared uptrend working higher it fits nicely off the lows prices traded up higher we have overshoot super far away from ema ended up breaking the trend line and then continuing to make a new extreme high and what is the difference between an overshoot or a break of a trendline well the break of a trendline is always in counter trend direction like this we have uptrend and the break of a trendline happen in the bearish downtrend momentum and when we see a
(07:45) break of a trendline we are not starting to reverse trading yet we wait for prices to attempt to make a new extreme according to trendline rules and when we see overshoot overshoot happens with the trend direction we have a bullish uptrend and suddenly we keep piling up we keep piling up and eventually we overshoot the upper trend channel line with the trend this is overbought condition so this is the difference when it comes to overshoot and when it comes to regular break of a trendline and to summarize this the
(08:16) way we trade overshoots is if this overshoot is far enough from ema we can potentially pick the top or pick the bottom but more importantly when there is a high probability setup at the key entry point at the trend line we should sit on our hands and let the correction play out unless the trend is really strong but either way it is better to sit on our hands than to get trapped and since i keep talking about high probability setups let's talk about the day's price action because we started with an uptrend we have overshoot and we
(08:45) have a trend down is already talked about after that we push strongly about the ema and here i was a little bit unsure because i had two conflicting beliefs right now because we have an overshoot and we are treading to the downside so i was expecting breaking a new low but at the same time you have a break of this uptrend so you're expecting for prices to create a new extreme but if this downtrend is strong then price will stay below ema and the ema will hold prices and eventually create new extreme but it didn't happen
(09:14) we push strongly above the ema so this is the first indication that this bullish uptrend may resume now we have a first century long second entry long right here but right now we are going sideways in the middle of those bars this is a consolidation and you want to stay away from this because you know you're still unsure whether we can ended up trading lower you really don't know so stay sitting on your hands is the best option right now and we started making new highs and new highs this was my first initial trend line i
(09:43) had this tight little channel working higher but we have a new high another new high and another new high right here so once we had this confirmation this is when i thought that this would be a spike and the channel because this is a strong steep move up this is a spike and this is a nice geometrical formation and a third swing confirming so this is a spike in a channel and here we have our first trade of the day and this is tricky one because trader asked me today uh how you count second entries when you keep breaking the previous high and
(10:14) you make a new high does the count reset and the answer is yes if we have a new high right here we have a first century long pull back second entry long but we make a new high right here so we have to stop start counting over first century long and we don't give a get a second entry because this high is higher now than this high so pull back first century long we don't get second entry this high is higher than this high so count starts over pull back first entry and once again there is no second entry count starts over right here new high
(10:41) pullback first entry long once again only first entry so this is technically just a first entry but if you're advanced trader this looks like a tool like a pullback to the trend line you can see the two clear legs even if we ticked a few ticks higher above the previous high if you're being a trader don't worry about this don't listen to me this is the first entry and you want to skip this but if you're experienced trader and you see the spike in the channel because there's a confluence of two key entry points ema trend line you're trending above the
(11:11) ema and this is a nice big bullish bar so this is an uptrend and there's a confluence and looks like a two like a move so this is a good trade for advanced trader and prices ended up working higher here we have a first entry legit first entry but i think this is too aggressive to take you really want to wait for some high low at this point which comes all the way up to here but you don't want to go long in into this double top so i think it's best to sit on your hands it is it can be aggressive because you got once again confluence of two key entry
(11:39) points and the more key entry points you have the better the stronger stronger the signal is but it is just a legitimate first entry but i can see why an advanced trader would want to take a chance here prices are making higher highs and here we have strong mess strong consolidation this is where you want to really sit on your hands you wouldn't have this resistance line yet but you can see a lot of stems multiple stems we're going one two three four five you know 10 bars 14 bars going sideways you're not even
(12:10) close to the ema yet but you have a first century long second inch long off bouncing off the trend line but you're away from ema you're going along directly in this resistance inside of this congestion so you want to stay away from this congestion you don't really want to take any traits the best way to trade congestions is to fade the breakout oh and take a look we have a tiny little overshoot on a tiny little um tiny little time frame this is just two small bars and massive overshoot but more importantly we are in an
(12:41) uptrend and we if you have a failed brake lower below the overshoot you're expecting for price to create a new high of this spike and a channel now and this is why it is a nice big bullish bar and it ended up working and then eventually we made a second leg to a new extreme of this previous downtrend but when you zoom back this is definitely starting to look like you know at least somewhat of an uptrend there's a little the only bearish momentum was at the beginning of the day from that point on we were just working
(13:13) higher so there's no surprise we bounce over here and once we bounce over here and we have this two-legged move playing out you want to think about probably resuming the trend and you want to potentially look at this resistance and here we have a reverse pattern we have a push strongly above the ema first century short failure pullback second entry short failure nice bullish bar small little risk ema is holding prices nicely i was ready to go long about this bar right here but we didn't trigger higher we ended up
(13:47) having a bearish bar and then there was the entry nice entry reversal pattern felt second entry short in and out trend you want to take this long and then prices started to consolidate once again a lot of steams uh you're going very you're very close to this resistance and you have a lower high setup right here but you don't want to go long now into this resistance you're very close you're literally going exactly into this resistance we broke higher and most breakouts of trading ranges will fail so we pull back lower but i don't think
(14:16) you want to take the short here because the overall boss is up so you never know when you're going to you know pull push one tick higher and then reverse and by the time you get a lower high setup and a failed second entry long you're going short into this resistance that now may act as a support so this is a mess a lot of stems a lot of small bars so unfortunately not too eventful but there are a few setups on the way up here i'm going to mark this trade because looking back the two key entry points are really juicy
(14:50) and just because his first entry doesn't mean that you know this the spike in the channel pattern is valid here other than that uh if you take a shot here i can see why but it would be fairly aggressive so if you made it to this very end of the video that means you're enjoying the content so i will kindly ask you to hit the like button if you like it if you don't like it hit the dislike button doesn't really matter subscribe to the channel if you haven't and yeah take care everybody and i'll see you in next one bye

Transcript:
(00:00) the day started with a bearish leg down and what i'm going to do is i'm going to use a couple of previous days price action moves to make sense of what happened today what i'm going to do i'm going to draw a shortened downtrend off these lows to kind of get an idea where the dodger had started and the reason why am i doing this is because this high right here is a little bit higher than this eye and now it makes much more sense we have a downtrend working over we have a break and a new low according to trendline
(00:32) rules after trend line will break traders will attempt to make a new extreme so when i see this i see that the downtrend played out price created a new low and we have a first entry short first attempt by the bears to pull the market lower pull back second attempt by the mers to push market lower now this is starting to look like a reversal pattern and a couple bars later price pushed above the ema so when i'm watching this instantly i'm starting to shifting my mind i'm only going to be looking for reasons to buy this market because the
(01:07) downtrend played out reversal pattern occurred and we are now trending above the ema so once i see this bullish bar we broke above the ema i'm switching only into long's only mindset as i'm looking at the charts going higher and higher price create a new high and when i'm in an uptrend i'm looking for high probability entries and high probability entry is a two legged pullback at the key entry point key entry point is either trend line support resistance line or exponential moving average this blue line right here this
(01:40) is the 21 bar exponential moving average this is just a supportive indicator but it can act as a key entry point now i have a new high right here so i'm counting my entries first bearish bar first bullish bar and this is the first entry loan this is the first attempt by the bulls pulled push the market higher from this high right here and it worked there is no pullback there is no second entry so i'm just watching the market go and i'm just focusing on the second inches because first entries are not reliable as we
(02:08) keep making higher highs and higher lows what i can also do is i can find a potential trend line something like this because from the first two swings off the start of the day a lot of times this will give you an idea where the potential trend line is going to be so there's always some sort of trend line when there is a trend up so this was the trend line that i was looking for and this is the first two swings and you guys can see that the prices are confirming the trainer right here but it is not confirmed yet this is
(02:39) just first two swings the third swing confirms the trend line two swings just set the trend line we have a new high right here we have a first bearish bar another bullish bar and just a first entry and market continue working higher so i'm not doing anything i'm not interested in trading i'm just watching the market go i'm sitting on my hands because i'm looking for second entries at the key entry point now this is normally where the we would start trading because this is still the pre-market open session now the us open
(03:05) session is opening soon so this is normally well where a lot of professional traders are starting to trade we have a new high right here we have a bearish bar okay some selling pressure we have a first bullish bar and we have a first entry long so this is the first attempt by the bulls to push the market higher but i'm far away from key entry point it is not second entry so i'm not going to take this trade even though it's uptrend i'm just going to sit on my hands this is not a high probability setup and it failed first entry failed because
(03:33) it is just the first entry it's unreliable and we have a let me make it a little bit bigger we have a big big bearish bar another big bearish bar and we have a third bearish bar and notice how this third bearish bar suddenly doesn't look so strong as two previous bearish bar there's a stim at the eyes and stim at the lows this is very close to looking like a doji and there's a reason why right now we're at the ema and we are bouncing off the trendline we are at the key entry point so right now i'm starting to pay a little bit more
(04:04) attention still doesn't matter because still i need to see a bullish bar because we are buying okay so the next bar is bullish and now is the exact time when i'm starting to pay attention now am i going over again that i did i want to confirm what i'm looking at i see the new high i see first century long pull back pull back pull back second entry long may trigger soon this is a nice big bullish bar we are at the two key entry points more key entry points you have the better i'm going to draw my shortened tread
(04:32) line this is the first legged move pull back second leg is a two-legged move down and we are in an uptrend and the downtrend played out so i'm preparing my limit order at this point on to go long i'm not thinking short we are still in this uptrend i can put it even here to make it make it nicer so i'm watching the market and we didn't get the entry higher but we are still respecting the key entry point i'm still thinking that i'm gonna go long here make no mistake about it this candle will not shake us another bar is bullish we finally broke
(05:04) above this bullish bar so what can you do when you finally break above this bullish bar you you can place your rim in order as far as you want i normally put it at the closer one or two ticks further today i put it at the close and i got filled because you're at the two key entry points it is a second inch long and market is working higher you scalp out and your one contract is running now i want you to take a look on this price action i'm going to enlarge it so you guys can see how it looks on a bigger picture and
(05:33) this pattern is very similar to a pattern that occurred a couple fridays ago take a look guys we have a channel working higher we have a nice trend line we have a first lag pullback second leg little break new low three bearish bars and the two key entry points second entry long off two key entry points today started with an uptrend this is almost identical entry first century long second entry long two key entry points we are in this uptrend very similar pattern and i'm going to show you a similar pattern once again
(06:05) that happened a week ago and this is why i knew that i was going to use a previous day price action because the friday the august 6th happened exactly the same way we have a dungeon working over we have a break and a new low you have a first century short second entry short reverb although this is a double bottom so count is resetting you have a first entry short pull back second entry short and you're working higher there is a trend line there's a second entry long of this trend line very similar pattern so this is why i
(06:36) knew that i need to use the previous days price action because it acts the same way here we have just a first entry and it failed because this is just a first entry attempt now why i believe so strongly that the patterns will repeat well because it is tied down to human psychology every single trader who's putting trade into the market has a reason why they made their analysis that there are thousands of strategies that traders use it don't matter somebody is using rsi divergences somebody is using price action naked
(07:05) chart reading it all all these strategies will make formation on the chart and it will depict the human behavior this is why the patterns repeat over and over again you guys can see today's friday is playing out exactly as the previous days as i depicted now as i'm holding my runner and the market goes higher let's say you're not holding a runner as you're only scalping out what i'm doing right now we are working higher am i interested in selling or am interested in buying well i'm not interested in anything because i don't
(07:41) want to sell because we are still in this uptrend until we have a break in reaches of a new extreme i'm not interested in selling but i'm not going to go along either because we are far away from key entry point so i'm just going to sit on my hands and not do anything we have a first entry long at the very high it is not a thick entry point and prices are pushing lower now we have a second entry long that triggered and let me make a clear the first entry according to rules although i'm not going to market we have
(08:11) a second entry long day triggered above this bar but we cannot take the second entry long because it is a big bearish bar remember we are buying so this is the bar that we want to go long after or a potential doji looking bar but this is a full on bearish bar there like two or three ticks of a bearish body we cannot go long below ema on a bearish body like this even though we broke the trend line and we are expecting a new high so i'm sitting on my hands i'm just going to draw the trend line and look what we have here we have a
(08:40) potential first century long second entry long failure which would be a trap but this is not a trap because we are in an uptrend still and we don't have a new high so we cannot take this second entry short i'm just still sitting on my hands even though it is tempting i'm just still sitting on my hands excuse me felt like too long i'm sitting on my hands i'm letting this play out because i know that after price will break the trend line traders will attempt to make a new extreme so i'm sitting on my hands we finally have a
(09:05) break annual we have a big bullish bar okay now i'm starting to get interested because duncan played out and i may get a chance to go long this is too too big below ema so this is not a high probability setup and market just keeps working and there is no way for me to enter there is no reversal pattern this is a reversal pattern failed two attempts in the previous trades direction none of this happened right here i just have to sit on my hand just happy with my one trade and watch the market go without me and that's okay that's part
(09:35) of being a trader when you want to take a high probability setups we finally formed a new high now i see a big bearish bar like here quite a nice pin bar i'm not going to pick a top yet because that's not a high probability setup just yet i want to wait for reversal pattern from the upside we have a big bearish bar we have a bullish bar i'm just sitting on my hands i'm not doing anything we're bouncing off the ema so it may look like we may go along but no the uptrend played out with the break at a new high so i'm not doing anything
(10:06) i'm just sitting on my hands not doing anything still just watching okay we have a bearish bar not doing anything we don't even have a first century long we have a another bullish bar confirming the bounce off the ema and it looks like it traded down and at the very end of the bar traded higher this can be tempting but only to a novice trader because if you're advan no if you are aware of price action rules let me rephrase it you already know that i'm repeating myself but it is very important you already know that the trend played out
(10:36) with the break and in your high so we are not going to go along after all this move happened and when the downtrend is supposed to start or at least correction and result it in a trap big bearish bar i'm just sitting on my hands because if i want to go short i want to see a felt second entry long below ema but i don't get this here i'm just working over working lower um what do we have here now we'll take a look where we bounce we bounce right here we bounce right here we bounce right here and once again i got a flashback today like this very
(11:09) similar we continue working in a trading range you don't need to have a flashback of a previous memories to identify that there's some strong support here so what i'm going to do is i'm going to draw support put it somewhere around here you guys can see how nicely it confirms i can even put it at the top let's say put it right right here for now and you guys can see how we're starting to swing up and down up and down i'm going to zoom out a little bit so you guys can see the big pattern from the top to the lows up down up down
(11:45) so we're right now in a consolidating market okay the option played out we're in consolidated market so i'm looking to buy the lows and sell the highs and i'm going to once again draw the shortened trend line something like this so this is the first legged move break and second legged move to the support so the downtrend played out okay so i'm no longer interested in selling especially not after all this move at the very low of this trading range this is not a too good of a bar to take along here it would be a great bar it
(12:16) would be a first century long pullback second entry loan i'm going to mark it as an educational purpose only if this bar was a little bit more bullish if this was a bullish bar instead of bearish bar green bar green body this would be a good long because it is after breaking a new low to like a move down and a second entry long high probability set up at the key entry point but you cannot take this long yet so watching the market go you have a first entry short pull back you have a second entry short it's you're not going to go short
(12:47) on a second entry short at the bottom of a trading range after downtrend played out so you have to see on your hands but i'm expecting some sort of bounce here and what do we have here we finally have a bullish bar okay but we're still below ema this is not what i want to see right now as you guys can see there's a lot of congestion here one two three four five six seven bars going sideways right now this is a congestion tiny little congestion but it's there if this bar close above the ema this would be a good felt second entry
(13:18) shot to take what happened we are breaking this congestion okay and we instantly pull back lower this is how these congestions play out most breakouts of these congestions will just fail that's just how it is okay but right now you don't want to go short either i guarantee you there's a lot of people trading momentum seeing this big bearish bar and piling the shorts at the very low of this trading range it didn't stop them that the second entry short failed horribly they still see this big bearish bar and a lot of
(13:50) people make no mistake about it there's a hundred of strategies a lot of people trade a big candles they think there's some sort of significance and meaning to this it's absolutely horrible way to trade and now we finally have another entry now i'm going to mark this trade this was very tempting to trade live to take this trade this is advanced trade because the way i like it is because we broke higher pull back so the congestion played out we're coming off the low series looking for reasons to buy and this was a nice trap this big of a
(14:24) bar trapped a lot of people and a lot of people were selling in the middle of this bar and then a nice big bullish bar it is basically a continuation of this felt second entry short however at this point on there is a congestion even though if you have a small break higher and you pull back still you can make a case this is starting to look very congested congestive so definitely a beginner trader should sit on his hands and not do anything here because it is not worth taking but an advanced trader can see that you're
(14:55) basically it's about it's a matter of time when you're going to go higher from here and remember we're playing the training range rules and we are working higher we are working higher i'm not doing anything i'm not doing anything because we're far away from any engine but okay we're starting to get to the top so we may look for potential shorts and what do we have here we have a bearish bar even though this is a neutral close the stem is bearish it means we trade it up higher and the very end of the bar we continue working lower
(15:27) if you measure the legs either like this or like this you have a two-legged move up very similar to what we had right here but on our way down we have a two-legged move down you can see that the first leg is tiny the second leg is much bigger first leg is tiny and the second leg is much bigger we're at the high of the trading range uptrend played out and we are far away from ema so according to trading range rules this is an entry we can take because the option already played out okay we're coming off the highs
(15:58) and what do we get we get a nice perish move down so we have a nice base move down so what i'm going to do i'm going to draw my shortened trend line so that i know i'm on the right side of the market you guys can see i'm constantly drawing the shortened trend lines because i really want to see whether i'm doing things right or wrong because it all it is all playing out perfectly the brake new low the brake new high the brake new load the brake new high we're working lower oh and we're pushing way below ema okay okay so we may have a
(16:28) downtrend we have a first century long at the middle of trading range so i'm not going to do anything remember we want to skip the middle of trading range we have a first century long and it failed no surprise there we're trading lower trading lower we have a lower high setup but now it's at the middle of trading range we should rather skip this trade okay your first lag pull back second leg so the downtrend played out because we have a break and a new low we have a doji we have a big bearish bar okay so this is the second entry long
(16:59) it's starting to get tempting right now to look for buys because the downtrend played out but you never know whether you're going to get a few more pushes to this resistance to the support remember if it's a healthy training range which looks like it is right now you're going to go from the lows to the highs and from the highest to the lows so there's still some room you're in the middle so you want to wait okay you want to wait right now you have a second in too long i'm sitting on my hands and it looks like a second entry long failure
(17:24) so it looks like i felt second entry long i'm not gonna go short why because the downtrend played out okay so i'm not interested in shorting this market and this is very important because there's going to be advanced setup soon and i want to i want you guys to understand because the crucial information here is to really realize that the downtrend played out and it's a two-legged move down you're at the middle of trading range but i'm still letting the trade play out okay i'm not really thinking i'm gonna do do anything right now when i was
(17:57) watching in live and we're when we're watching it i'm just sitting on my hands even though the market is really slow it's friday i'm sitting on my hands i'm in the middle of training range yes i want to go long but not really because i'm expecting still move here so i'm letting the trade play out and look what we have it looked like we're going to have a nice failed second entry long and we're going to push lower but at the very end of the bar we traded up higher and at this point on since i'm watching this and we managed to close
(18:25) slightly above the ema or at the ema as i'm watching this i'm starting to think that a lot of sellers got trapped here on a failed second entry long they're looking at this as a trap and they don't realize that the downtrend played out okay so we traded down lower big time and ended up working higher so i'm starting to think i might get along here it is going to be aggressive trade because i'm in the middle of trading range but there's something telling me that we just cannot move lower we didn't make a move down on
(18:56) the first leg we didn't make a move down on the second leg and now we have a trap potential and we couldn't even make it down here what is this okay what is this there's a lot very few sellers left and then we have a nice bullish bar above the ema basically confirming what i want to see and my thought process prior to this bar so i'm going to mark this trade it is aggressive trade because we are right now in the middle of trading range but an advanced trader with everything i've described should be able to recognize this and
(19:26) your bias should be up okay and it took a little bit it looked like it was going to stop me out and it didn't my stop was still would be below this bar okay and it worked barely it's starting to get congested now we're working higher i'm expecting for price to reach this upper side of the trading range okay i'm expecting for prices to reach this upper side of trading range we have a break new high you have first century long right here you have a lower high setup but it is starting to get very confusing now what's going on are we gonna go long are
(20:01) we gonna go short we're not even touching the support we're not touching the resistance so at this point on i was just sitting on my hands it's starting to get very congested now it's starting to look really like a congestion like a no man's land you're definitely now in the middle of training range you can't make it either to one of those extremes and it just ended up chopping and you want to stay away from this there is a congestion you have a fail break lower most breakouts of these congestions will fail and right now you're continuing to work
(20:35) higher but you're just stacked ema is exactly in the middle of those bars it is better to stay away from this and this is how you read the price chart bar by bar so hopefully this was helpful important thing is to realize that it is really useful to get the experience because this is extremely similar to this right here and even if i go if you take a look at this downtrend break in a new low and this reversal pattern that resulted into uptrend this is almost identical what happened right here break new low reversal pattern that
(21:10) resulted into an uptrend all you just have to do is have a little bit of experience and these patterns will repeat they repeat over and over the charts are the same 40 years ago anyway i'm gonna stop rambling and this was the chart for today once again not too many setups this was a easy setup anybody can spot this what more this is the perfect price action two-legged move second entry long two key entry points in an uptrend even if you just take one trade a day this trade right here i mean it's okay to make 200 a day
(21:44) trading 10 minutes you know that should be you should be absolutely fine with that there's always going to be one or two good trades a day that is worth waiting on and if you're just patient the traits will make their way to the kianchi points okay so i wish you a good weekend relax and clear your mind and hopefully the next week is going to be much more volatile so take care buddy








(270) THE NUMBER ONE Way To Trade Reversals - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMkdZVtU-9o

Transcript:
(00:00) welcome back to my youtube channel in this video i'm going to show you guys how to successfully predict that the trend is reversing i'm going to give you guys a few tips that you can use in your own trading how to look for reversals now we have a downtrend working lower on the chart it's a clear downtrend series of lower highs lower lows this is what the day started with and at the start of each day there's going to be always some sort of trend either shorten or the larger one either option or downtrend even if it's just a trading range
(00:28) there's going to be a potential trend every single day we have a downtrend working low and we are just now breaking the upper trend line and we are pushing strongly about the ema so this is looking like the trend is resuming right we may actually start buying now right no because according to trendline rules after price will break the trend line traders will attempt to create a new extreme buying this breakout will just sucker people in into bad trades okay because right now this downtrend is working over we just broke the trend
(00:59) line and traders will attempt to create a new extreme and this is what exactly what happened this was just a temporary break recreate it if you're lower highs and market keeps pushing strongly below the ema we formed a new law right here this is the break this is the new low we now have a finally a new extreme so after this point on we are waiting for straight up reversal or at least correction and look what happened right here strong four big bullish candles working up higher and we are pushing above the ema at this point on when i'm looking at
(01:33) the chart and i'm seeing this this is in my mind i'm starting to prepare myself to start buying the market because the downtrend played out with the new low strongly pushing above the ema this is what we want to see when we are predicting a trend we want to see a strong push above the ema but i'm not just buying yet because i want to see a reversal pattern reversal pattern is characterized by two felt attempts in the previous trends direction previous trend was bearish so i want to see felt second entry short i
(01:59) want to see two felt attempts by the market to go lower and fail and the ema must be holding that's the important part here and look what happened next uh-oh what is happening we are pushing way below ema i definitely don't want to go long right below ema here and i definitely don't want to go along right here so from this point on i'm abandoning my reverse strategy and i'm just sitting on my hands because we were supposed to be about the ema and we were supposed to be working higher so even though the downtrend played out i
(02:28) haven't bought the market yet even though i have a new low i haven't bought the market yet because i need to wait for the high probability setup then market just started crawling up higher and take a look how this is a slow choppy move up this is not this move right here this was a very strong investing move this is just choppy a lot of stems a lot of bars we have a low right here first century short second entry short now that we turn down here and we turn down here we turn down here there is a bigger pattern that you can
(02:55) find it looks something like this this is the bigger downtrend that develop and took a little bit of time so now that we definitely see this we definitely don't want to go long we are still in a downtrend this is just a temporary shorter term one and the bigger one is now taking precedence there's a lower high setup which is a great trade according to our price action rules because this is now a fourth confirmation of this trend line this is a lower high set up nice bearish bar here and this the trend line is holding prices nicely but the
(03:29) market is right now working lower will be low ema so i'm completely forgetting about the reversal right now because this is now a clear downtrend we are back below ema we are back making lower highs lower lows this is a clearly a downturn so when i'm in a downtrend i'm looking for second entry shorts unfortunately we didn't get a good second entry this is looking like a two-legged move very tempting but this low is lower than this one so this is just a first entry now that the market is keeps making lower highs keeps making lower highs
(04:01) keeps making lower highs there's the new low there's the first entry off the ema but it's just a first entry and price keeps working higher and look what happened right here strong push above the ema so what i'm going to do i'm going to draw my trend line we have a tiny little break and a new high but i'm doing here the same thing as i did right here just because we broke the trend line in a quite a strong of a move just like we did right here i'm not buying the market yet because according to rules price will attempt to make a
(04:36) new extreme down that doesn't mean i'm just gonna pick a top right here out of nowhere because we still need a confirmation that the trend down is resuming we may keep continue working higher because nothing is 100 in price action but more often than not the price action rules will pan out and look what happened right here strong push back below ema this is a similar situation to what happened right here break of a trend line we're just trapping a lot of people who are willing to go long way too early and we're pushing below ema
(05:07) and we have a pullback lower high setup below the ema we are waiting for price to create a new extreme this is a good high probability setup a market keeps pushing lower keeps pushing lower and finally we have a new extreme just like we have new extreme right here we have a new stream right here from this point on i stop thinking about selling the market i'm only thinking that i'm either going to sit on my hands because this is a fairly strong downtrend it's probably not going to reverse that quickly and if it's going
(05:37) to reverse i'm starting to think long if i have a good reversal pattern market keeps working keeps working we have a ema is holding trend line is still holding and we have a second entry short which would be a high probability setup of two key entry points but this is a trap because we already have a new low in play and this downtrend is clear to find this there are four confirmations of this downtrend so even a beginner trader can find this fairly easily so this is looking like a tempting trade but it's just a trap
(06:07) because this is already after the trend played out and look what we have right here we have a new law right here you have a first century short pullback second entry short failure this is very close to looking like a reversal pattern but it is not above the ema we closed below the ema and this is very important because the true reversal pattern closes above the ema just because it worked here now doesn't mean it's going to work next time so i'm just giving you the tips so you you don't have to ask me next time
(06:39) why this pattern would fail on you advanced trader can still take this trade because the context is you know fairly easy to read but this is my a tip to you and the right now the market is consolidating we're going sideways quite a bit and this is a congestion the only way you can trade congestion and not have a losing trade is you fade the breakout you trade the breakout in the opposite direction so we have a congestion we're working sideways price created another low and this is a double bottom confirmation of the new
(07:11) extreme that the downtrend created and look what we have here strong bullish move up three big bullish bars this is starting to look like this right here we have a finally new low and a strong push above the emf double bottom is giving even more fuel to the fire here that we may reverse here so and when i'm seeing this i'm definitely not thinking short and i'm starting really strongly thinking about longs and we have a first century short pullback second entry show right here about the ema and it felt right here
(07:44) this is what is called a textbook reversal pattern because the downtrend played out with the break new low we have additional double bottom re-test so you know that we are for sure not going lower this is a good confirmation that you know that we are not going even lower strong rally above the ema and the two felt attempts in the previous trends direction which was bearish we are holding above the ema and the market keeps working higher and the runner you would still be holding runner to this very end of the day
(08:19) this is a very strong and powerful setup as you guys can see today this was just one setup like this but this was a major trend and this is what it's called a major trend reversal you're not going to have a bunch of these during the day but this reversal pattern you can use it even on the shortened trends in a trading range it doesn't have to be on a bigger picture like this it just happened today that this reversal pattern created a major trend reversal and the market keeps working higher this is just the first entry unfortunately so
(08:49) this is not entrable we have a little bit of a congestion working right here and we have a fail break lower confirming the trend line i'm going to mark this as an aggressive entry and then i'm also going to mark this as aggressive entry because it's just a first entry i probably would have not taken this personally but at this point this is just a strong trend very steep and you're just making first entries and you have a break of this uptrend you have a move down but we are not starting to sell yet because we're
(09:18) waiting for price to create a new extreme so this would be a confirmation of the ema and just a first entry a little bit too aggressive but nevertheless it is right here now i have marked a few more aggressive setups which a trader who is a little bit ex more experienced in price action can take these set up so this was the second entry show that i marked only if you already find the trend line me personally i just found the trend line uh right after we created the lower high here but it was fairly doable to find a straight line of these
(09:50) three swings right here so this would be a second entry short in a downtrend then i marked this technically a first entry short but you guys can see this is a double top at the ema and this looks very close like a two legged move to the ema we just created a little bit lower low but this is a clear tool like a move back to the exponential moving average then i marked a dish tray that could have probably tripped traders and the entry would have been right here because when you're watching this downtrend you're below ema right here you have a
(10:21) break and a new high and you have a two legged move up but right now we are above the ema we push strongly above the ema where and we didn't manage to um was worried we didn't manage to trigger below this second entry short bar right here and at this point on there should be enough evidence for you that you know there's something off happening because we're supposed to be first of all we're supposed to be closing below the ema if i want to go short here on a second entry short in a downtrend but not only we closed about the ema the
(10:54) next bar was was bullish as well and then once again above the ema a trader can get tripped up right here so this is why i marked it because if you're following the rule uh you did not do anything wrong here by taking this trade this is what i want to say because this is still a downtrend fairly strong and just because you're above the ema this still looks like a fairly good trade we're trying to make a micro double bottom right here we're not getting to the bottom side right here and this was a strong bullish move up
(11:23) so there are signs that the market is starting to bottom out but nevertheless this was a decent trade as well this lower high was perfect confirmation push back below ema unfortunately there was no setup during this mess you just really want to sit on your hands right here nice micro double bottom right here and another fairly aggressive setup which is the felt break below this congestion but the only reason why i like taking this and not only because this is a failed breakout build this congestion which we are
(11:54) fading we are training this in the opposite direction of the breakup breakout was the downside so we're feeding it to the upside but it is because now you created a double bottom and you confirmed the new low so this is really aggressive still but i know a lot of traders like to take in this aggressive setup so this is a great setup as well so you guys find this video helpful uh not that many clear perfect setups but you know the reversal pattern is your go-to setups when you're looking for change of reversal so if you guys
(12:26) enjoyed the video and i'm going to see you guys the next one take care buddy





(270) How to Identify Market Context for BEST Setups - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0aud04jpag

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video we'll go over how to identify the proper context using simple tools that we have in our disposal first we need to do is we need to put our 21 bar ema on the chart it looks like this this is a supportive indicator and then we're going to be using trend lines and i'm going to show you guys how to draw the trend lines properly when you're not sure how to draw them all right guys take a look at the right side of the chart and please ignore the left side of the chart because this is the yesterday session we're going to be
(00:27) doing our analysis on today's session and what we see right from the get-go is we're doing a pretty market analysis and the ema is pointing down and this is a supportive indicator and once ema is pointing down and prices are below the ema this indicates a downtrend so naturally what i have to do first i need to put it in some sort of range and i'm going to use trend lines and i'm going to use trend lines because i want to see where the break of the trend line is because following price action trend line rules after price will break the
(00:58) trend line traders will attempt to create a new extreme and this is really important because take a look what we have right here we have a first break of this bearish dungeon this dodger is fitting fairly nicely and price just created a three big bullish bars so most traders who are starting out their first instinct would be to start buying but that would be wrong even though this is looking fairly bullish remember what is the context here the context is strongly bearish and the price action rules are telling us we need to wait for a new
(01:27) extreme okay and since i have this downturn working lower i also want to draw my shortened trend lines and just a reminder why am i drawing the trend lines tight like this and not wider like this it's because it is because this is the bigger pattern and these are just short term corrections okay when the market is reversing i'm going to be drawing the wider ones when the market is bigger downtrend and these uptrends i'm not going to enjoy it like this i'm going to do it like this these are just short term corrections so i'm going to
(01:56) do the same thing right here this is our first break of this trend line what do we have here we have a first century short second entry short a market pull back below the ema this is exactly what we were expecting following perfect price action was the context is still better here okay okay this is still too early so i'm going to go through this fairly quickly and look what happened here a lot of times when you have a break and an attempt to create a new extreme that can be enough sometimes attempt is close enough so take a look at right
(02:26) here the context is still bearish but it's starting to change here the contact is starting to be a little bit more over trading range like and we can actually reverse because this this is a fairly big bullish move up but look what happened next that completely changes the context we have a big bearish bar that creates a double top right here right creates a double top right here and pushes back below the ema not only that there are two legs bullish legs that just played out this correction market moves in twos two
(02:57) legged pullbacks and second entries that's a high probability setup if you combine it with the proper key entry point so now that i'm looking at this the market is starting to look bearish once again but it's not enough yet for me to go short because this is looking fairly bullish and we could have just you know this could have been attempt and it could have been enough and we could be rallying up high but look what happened next market is pushing lower and we take one tick or a few ticks higher and instantly
(03:23) reverse down this is a lower high setup of this bar right here this double top right here and this is a more confirmation the price really pushed below ema traded up higher and instantly reversed down this was my first trade for today and the context the context is bearish why because we have a downtrend working lower price is below ema okay price is once again back below ema double tap is you're holding and we are waiting for a new extreme the bulls failed they failed break above here and they turn back blood ema
(03:57) and market just created a quick easy move down and look what we have here price finally formed a new extreme okay so when this happens i'm no longer focusing on selling i'm expecting reversal or possibly correction what is happening next is the market keeps pushing lower and keeps making few more legs down that's okay i s i'm you know not really selling at this point on because i have new extreme and if we keep making new extremes then i can look for bigger pattern i can potentially look for spike in the channel something like this if we get if
(04:30) we keep making new lows but take a look how market is starting to waiver you keep making lower pushes the pushes are slower and you're starting to chop chop around here okay but what is the context here can anybody tell me the context here is still bearish though even though we have a breaking news i'm not looking to sell we still don't have reversal yet we still don't have any sign of bullish pressure or anything so the context is still bearish we can end up you know creating a new extreme a new extreme and
(04:57) we can be pushing lower we don't know that yet so right now though we're sitting on our hands and look what is happening next market keeps pushing strongly above the ema all right and when this happens right here your first what you're starting to think is that we are reversing and since we are reversing you want to be really 100 sure that the market is reversing and how do we recognize that the market is safely reversing okay what we want to see is we want to see a reversal pattern and we look for reversal pattern number one
(05:29) after a new extreme is form of the previous trend previous trend is bearish okay and the new low is definitely formed so the downtrend played out we have a push above the ema that's the part of the reversal pattern we need to push above the ema where we're looking for reversal of the downtrend into uptrend and we need to have two felt attempts in the previous trans direction this is the lowest slope that we created of this bearish move down we have a first century short pullback pullback pullback second entry
(05:57) short failure okay and now that i see this i'm going to draw this trend line right here can we take this reversal pattern though it meets all the criteria of what i have mentioned but no we cannot take this why because we're not touching the ema we're far away from ema and the best reversal pattern is the one that you're touching the ema nicely okay so skip this reversal pattern the context here is however bullish okay you got the trend line you got the reversal pattern you're pushing above the ema and market keeps
(06:26) working here and once again why am i not drawing trend line tight like this you can even draw attack like this there's no problem with it but market is reversing now this is no longer correction this is a trend reversal so after you have a reversal pattern extend the trend line and make it a little bit wider you cannot keep it tight like this in the corrections so when i was watching this live i was right now starting to think bullish because market played out the downtrend played out and we are strongly pushing higher but we have just bunch of
(06:53) first entries and when we're pushing higher like this take a look at the ema the context right now what is the context here 100 bullish there is no question about it okay so and we even though we know the context is bullish here we're probably looking for a bigger pattern and you're wondering how do i find a bigger pattern you don't find a bigger pattern yet this is not enough information for you to find a bigger pattern yet all you know is that the context is bullish because ema is pointing higher and price is trending
(07:18) above it so you're looking for second entry longs with the trend what do you have here first century long you just sit patiently what do you have here okay new high first break of this uptrend you're expecting probably new extreme do we get second entry no we don't get second entry we just get a new extreme and market keeps pushing higher so the context once again 100 percent bullish we have a break any new extreme so this means i'm no longer looking for longs okay even though this is extremely strong trend you have to respect the trend lines
(07:49) after price will break the trend line traders will attempt to create new extreme and it happened right here okay and here's a great setup right here you have a new high first century long pull back little jack lower and a second entry long failure look how many people went along here on a second entry so far away from ema after price created a new extreme i'm going to mark this as aggressive entry i didn't take this trade myself but a lot of aggressive traders can take this trip because you know a lot of beginner
(08:15) traders watch this go entire move and they are trying to go along at the very high remove far away from ema after uptrend played out so this is a great trade you get a lot of room to the ema the context is still bullish okay when i was watching this when the market got right here since this is such a strong move up i wasn't honestly respecting expecting market to break below ema i was 100 expecting ema holding prices and i was preparing my limit order that i'm gonna get some potential set up around the ema because context is
(08:43) bullish but what happened here was strong push below ema and this caught me off guard because what you do in this situation is the market really bullish or is the market starting to be bearish okay well at this point on uh the context is starting to look bearish because the uptrend played out and we're pushing back below the ema so when i was looking at this i was expecting okay we may push lower context is starting to be very so i'm going to be looking for reasons to sell that's your natural instinct that you should be
(09:14) expecting okay you're following the price action rules look how it all works efficiently but what happened here completely changed the game you had a strong poke push back above the ema and now this is a new low first century short high low setup and take a look at overall this is the context bullish or bearish what do you think this is the most recent swing down it's more recent push down yes but the overall price action is really bullish and the fact that we push back above the ema is huge so it this is an indication that we are
(09:46) the trend is resuming and here you can find actually your potential channel let me see it looks something like this i'm just going to copy it put it to the other side and you can even see how nice it fits off the lows okay so but i just didn't have enough information yet to draw it here but once we get pushed right here that's what set up the trailer and when i was watching this what should you be expecting what do you think i was expecting according to trendline rules and uh following the price action i was expecting felt second
(10:17) entry short okay even a higher low would be a good if the signal bar was great because the context is bullish i'm looking for reasons to go long i now have this upper trend line which confirms that i should be only looking for longs but i don't even get a pullback lower i don't get no failed second entry short like here here was a felt second entry short failed here just first entry short above the ema failed so no setup okay and remember guys only setup i took was this setup right here at one o'clock so all this i'm doing i'm
(10:44) sitting and being extremely patient okay because and that's the name of the game you have to be really patient when you're watching the chart and you get no high probability setups okay so in this point the context is bullish i have a little trendline working higher we're pushing above the ema this is 100 bullish market what i like to do i like to draw my highs of a trading range just in case we reach all the way up to here and i may potentially look for pullback if we are really far away from ema but at this point on the market is
(11:13) looking bullish and look what happened here this is going to be a tricky situation we have a new high we have a sort of like a first entry on the inside bar pull back and i was watching this when i was watching this live this was really tempting but i was looking at this we are not quite touching the ema there's still a gap especially if you're not touching even with a wick with the tail this is really telling you something i would like to touch with the body and the bar is doji so even though this is looking like a tool like a pullback a
(11:42) micro level in an uptrend we're coming off the upper trend line so you're most likely going to go to the other side there is i draw a trend line something like this i draw trend line something like this and you're not touching dna this is a doji bar and look i thought i was going to miss this trade but then i got rewarded for being patient because it ended up just trapping a lot of traders and market kept pushing those so you have to respect the short term trend line this is why it is so important and look what happened here you have a
(12:12) bullish bar here and what is the context here by the way once again what is the context here is the context bearish because we are starting to reverse here or is the context still bullish well the context is still 100 bullish no question about it may be extremely uh trivial question but we need to reinforce that so now we have this bullish bar and i was watching this i was preparing my limit order 100 i already prepared my limit order but i was like okay we still have this downtrend we're below ema so i'm going
(12:38) to be patient and i'm not going to take this trade because i don't want to get trapped but look what happened next you had a big bearish bar that traded lower and failed to do so and at the very end of the bar reversed higher look at this look how many people started buying at the end of this bar this even though he's a bearish body it is tiny one take bearish body this is extremely bullish pressure here i took my second trade right here okay if this bar wasn't good looking like this i would not enter on this
(13:09) inside bar because we still have this dungeon here i barely managed to get out on just two point uh two points or how much room did i have let me oh let me all right so i had 44 25 44 for 50. so i had two ticks left to spare um on this bar so as you guys can see really eight ticks is such a tiny little move so a lot of you guys want to go only for one point but even take a look how two points it's still really tiny move so even though um you can read it a little bit wrong uh you can still get out easily as a skull this is why scalping is such a
(13:48) powerful thing but i still think this was a good trade because of this bearish bar ended up bullish and you're at the key entry point this is really important this is a bigger pattern now and you're at the key entry point and you have to take the trade but look what happened next if a downtrend working lower you have a break new extreme what does happen what does that mean after breaking new extreme the trend is over but at this instance we are below ema so as i was watching this i was expecting some higher low push
(14:15) above the ema and by the time you get this this is not really integral because your stop loss has to go below this and market just went without me however i will mark this trade because it is extremely tempting the signal bar is big but if you're sneaking with the limit order for the back this is a good way to trade because downtrend played out the context is still bullish okay because especially now when the downtrend played out when you're looking at this the context is 100 percent bullisher i'm only thinking
(14:43) along at this point on and this is a nice bullish bar so when i'm watching this i'm expecting for price to create a new extreme naturally break up the bigger pattern i'm looking for a new extreme what is happening right here push below ema uh oh all right so it may take some time below before we get back about the ema it's it's something like here okay we just first traded about the ema then continue into trend and push again above the ema and continue into trend okay so we're pushing above the ema little correction so when i'm watching
(15:14) this i'm not selling yet okay when i'm watching this i'm not selling it i'm still thinking long but market key is pushing lower and look what's happening market why is market pushing lower and not above the ema okay here we have a few bearish bars and look what you have here market tried to push above the ema and instantly failed and we are below ema this is a two legged pullback do you guys see it two legged pullback this is a hidden second entry because we didn't trigger below this bearish bar but it you guys can see that you have a
(15:46) bullish bar bullish bar bearish move bullish bar very smooth this is a two-legged pullback second entry at the ema and this is now telling us that the context is starting to shift it's no longer it's no longer bullish because we are failing to break above the ema and of these laws you can find nicely a trend line and this is what i was looking at i didn't take this trade because already take a look i took my first trade at around let's say one o'clock and here at 16 15.
(16:20) so it was a three hours three hours of just sitting here and being patient your patience is the name of the game if you don't see a setup you don't want to be gambling you want to be really sure you're reading the price action correctly so i was you know my trading battery was already uh gone i was really not really feeling trading no more so i took two setups and i called it a day but this is a nice two-legged pullback at the ema and context is shifting because we cannot make it above the ema if we like here we push back below the ema so this is a good
(16:48) indication that the downtrend is resuming here we didn't close above the ema okay we didn't close above the ema so the context is bearish it's no longer bullish and we keep pushing over we keep pushing lower it's gonna adjust the trendline a little bit we have a new low first entry short i'm just thinking short right now okay because a lot of times attempt to create a new stream is enough uh however there's new load is the first century short market is pushing higher i'm going to draw my short term trend line something like this the context is
(17:23) context is bearish but we're pushing now about the ema and look what you have next and this is probably the most confusing situation today because the context is bearish and you have a first break of this lower downturn working lower but at the same time you push back above the ema and you may have a new extreme of this overall uptrend okay you push back about the ema and you have a new extreme potential of this overall uptrend so what do you have what do you do now when you have a two conflicting beliefs you have the short
(17:58) term uptrend you have this bigger downtrend you just sit on your hands okay you just sit on your hands because you're not really sure you have a new high first century long second inch long emma is holding this may be potential entry i will mark it because somebody i guess somebody can actually take it this could be a potential trait to take a chance on here but i really was paying more attention to the downtrend here because the uptrend tried to create a new extreme right here and it failed and we were below ema and once
(18:25) you create this first century long pull back second entry long failure back below ema this is where you want to take a short here okay i only mark this because i know uh if you're watching it more focusing on the uptrend you may potentially take a trend here trade here okay but this was a good enough information that we cannot make in your extreme we cannot push above the ema and we keep failing and this downtrend is starting to look fairly big look how the big the downtrend is okay and the market keeps pushing lower so the context right
(18:55) now is 100 bearish and what you have here you have a new extreme okay you have a new extreme the context is still bearish though but i'm sitting on my hands i'm i don't sell anymore and market keeps pushing back above the ema okay oh okay we keep pushing him off the email we keep pushing about the ema what do you think the context is here now after the downtrend played out with the break and in your extreme the context here the context here is starting to be bullish it looks like a little bit of a trading range but the
(19:32) overall uh trend it looks like it's starting to gain the strength after this downtrend played out with the breaking in your extreme you pushed heavily above the ema so what you're looking for if you want to take a trade reverse the pattern first century short second entry short failure but once again you're not touching the ema it is coming off to trendline but it is a quite a bearish bar and it's just a first entry so once again it is better to skip this trade once again reverse the pattern market moves in twos felt
(20:00) second entry such a high probability setup but you don't want to take a chance and market keeps pushing higher and is finally on its way to create this new extreme all right guys so hopefully you find the video helpful just remember it is important to be patient because there were not that many traits from in in this area because a lot of you uh weren't trading and here i was trading really early here today decided to take this trade and this was a little bit aggressive and and then you have a few good trades right here and then here so
(20:31) you have to be patient throughout this section right here and you know it is really important being patient and not forcing trades trading is only psychological and jumping the gun and if you want to take a trade because you want to be a little bit early and trade the setup is not really there that's when you're going to the mental error all right guys so make sure you study your charts over the weekend you wanna get a leg up on your competition and i'm gonna see you guys on monday so take care everybody

(00:00) market can sometimes be fairly confusing and not every single day it is easy to find a good pattern but there is one tool in our toolbox that we can use as traders to make sure we are following the price action properly and the days we're going to use our trend lines more specifically shortened trend lines they will keep us on the right side of the market and no trend lines are not as subjective as you may think for the first thought of hearing about this because there is a rhyme and reason how price action moves and there are rules
(00:29) on how you draw your trend lines and number one rule you will need to think about and keep in your mind while you're trading is that after price will break the trend line new extreme is most likely going to be retested now you don't draw these trend lines just for the sake of it you draw this trendline so you know where the high probability setup will occur and high probability setup is a tool like a pullback second entry it seems fairly easy this is going to be high probability setup but this depicts a human behavior and it will
(00:56) work now let's talk about how we would draw our trend line on the structure today because when we draw shortened trend lines we want to draw them as tight as possible as you guys can see this is a nicely fitting uptrend we have a break of this uptrend and according to price action rule the new extreme is most likely going to be retested and you have a break new high pull back another new extreme pull back another new high when you guys can see the price keeps making you highest and your highs that means that there is a
(01:24) most likely a bigger pattern in play because this overall move is way too big for this tiny little uptrend so what i'm going to do i'm going to extend the trend line just slightly to make sure it fits better as you guys can see it now is working nicely in this uptrend price really fits nicely in this option so this is a bush uptrend now we are drawing the trend lines with the direction of a trend the same thing we need to do against the direction of a trend account trend wise because we want to see when the downtrend played out in
(01:52) this instance you have a downtrend working lower and it didn't play out because there is a break but there is no new extreme because this trend line was too strong so when there is a new extreme and there is a new downtrend but look what you have you have a break and a new low so that means according to trend line rules the price action that this downtrend played out with the breaking new low not only that this is a two legged pullback this is this pattern right here and it's located where at the ema which is a key entry
(02:21) point overall in the direction of a trend so this would be a high probability pattern i'm just marking it only as an example because your stop loss will go one tick below this swing right here and this is not good risk to reward ratio this is just an example entry now we have a break of this uptrend so we are most likely expecting the new extreme so we're looking still for reasons for market to push higher a new high was formed right here and after you see a market creating a new extreme there are two things that can occur either market
(02:53) can go into correction for let's say like 30 minutes at least or market can straight up reverse so when you see a new stream right here you're no longer expecting for price to keep working higher in bullish direction you guys can see you have a new high and as the market keeps pushing lower the first my first drawing for the trend line was something like this right here because i want to see price once again fitting inside of this channel nicely and you guys can see market kept really overshooting it and really overshooting
(03:24) it so i had to adapt and the trend line ended up being something like this because the way i draw it was way too short and mark it didn't really fit nice and look how price is nicely fitting now as you guys can see you have a new extreme that was formed and you have a first century long price push below ema confirming the bearish momentum confirming the reversal that after new high was formed and a second entry long failure this is a high probability pattern you may be wondering why when a tool like a pullback this is
(03:57) not really a tool like a pullback this is actually a failure of a two like a pullback and that is correct this is a failed second entry long but why this two-legged pullback failed it failed because price the uptrend already played out with the brake and a new extreme and then we are expecting correction or straight up reversal in this instance strong push below ema indicating reversal so this is a high probability setup i didn't take this trade myself i i didn't really recognize it yet but this is a high probability set up here a
(04:28) market just pushed lower as you guys can see it is nicely fitting inside of this trend line you have a little overshoot of this trend line and overshoot a lot of times lead to break of a trend line or either straight up reversal you have to understand that the overshoot is not unnatural activity in the market and traders will act upon this okay so once the market is working in this trend line what you're doing you're looking for a high probability setup and you're looking for a second entry shot where you're looking for this tool like a
(04:55) pullback and price created a new low and you have a first century short pullback second entry short and this is a this high probability pattern however once again don't forget you have to draw the short term corrections in the opposite direction shorten trendlines in the opposite direction as well and here you guys can see that the price didn't really play out yet this show the shortened uptrend is still in place so i'm going to mark this entry as an aggressive entry because you are at the key entry point you close below on a
(05:25) nice bearish bar and after first break of this downtrend you're expecting a new low to be retested so this is slightly aggressive because you have to respect this uptrend price broke this up trend formed a new high and look it never looked back nothing is 100 in price action this was attempt to create a new extreme and this is sometimes enough that doesn't matter because you stopped selling because as price keeps pushing above the ema that is indicating bullish momentum and there is no bearish bar anyway so there
(05:58) is even not a chance to sell you just watch here the market go without you and the market keeps pushing higher and the same thing that happened right here is happening right here there is a break there is new extreme another break another new extreme and you just keep pushing higher and you just keep pushing higher so that means that there is most likely a bigger pattern in place so what i'm going to do i'm going to draw this trendline and i'm going to have a slightly larger trend line here okay and you guys can
(06:29) see we have a new extreme form right here i'm looking for the same thing as i'm always looking i'm looking for the high probability to like a pullback so i'm going to draw my shortened trend line in the opposite direction as well and this is the exact same pattern and that does happen right here you have this downtrend you have a break and you have a new low where coming off this trend line i'm using the shortened trendline rules to tell me that this downtrend played out price closed above the ema this is a nice big bullish bar
(06:56) and this is a high probability setup that i personally took this is my first trip for the day and a lot of traders in this court took this trade this was a gorgeous entry and price created a quick easy scalp now as the price form a new high right here and we are getting very close to this new high i actually have it a little bit right here because you can see there's a micro double top right here and it confirmed this bounce right here we're getting dangerously close to this resistance but we still have to follow
(07:28) the trend line rules we have a first break of this uptrend so we are expecting a new high to be formed and we have a new new law right here you have a first century short pullback second entry short but you're going along directly into this resistance when you're kind counting from the highs new high first century long pull back second entry long it closed above a bearish bar so there is no entry and market just keeps pushing higher and keeps pushing higher there's just a bunch of first entries and you have the same situation
(07:59) you had initially right here you have the short shorter term option working higher and you keep making new highs and you're high so that means there's probably a bigger pattern in place so what i'm going to do i'm going to draw my channel like this okay and you may be asking me okay but here you have a breaking new extreme and you have a reversal why don't you have it here break new extreme and you have a reversal this is just one of possibilities market will correct and either resume or it will straight up correct and then reverse okay but you
(08:31) not sell you don't sell if the market is not giving you the clues to sell okay the market is still chopping above the ema you still keep making higher highs so even though you have a new extreme you're not selling here you can be selling because markets strongly below ema and gave you the reversal pattern okay here you're just continuing pushing higher so there is no cell and there is a cell here it's all in the momentum of the ema here the market keeps nicely pushing higher now the market keeps working higher you
(09:02) have a new high you have a first century long pullback second entry long there's a little bit shortened trend line like this but at this point on market is looking very congested you guys can see there are bunch of bars stacked right next to each other uh it is quite a bearish bar uh this is a very aggressive entry i don't like it as much you know i'm going to mark it but personally i didn't take it straight nor i like it too much because you're going along very close to the high of the day there is not that much of a room
(09:35) and it looks like we're very close to all-time high or we're creating the all-time highs so i personally skipped it but take a look you're at the bottom of the congestion and you're coming off the key entry point and what it looks like is now a strong uptrend okay a market keeps pushing and once the market keeps pushing higher right here you're just focusing on reasons to buy you're not picking top because that would be a counter trend entry and that is not smart a market keep pushing higher you have a new extreme your first
(10:06) century long pull back second entry long you can draw the shortened trend line but you're far away this tool like a pullback is far away from key entry point so you're not taking this anyway you have a first century long and look what you have here you have a new extreme right here so what i'm going to do i'm going to draw my shortened trend lines because i want to stay on the right side of the market and i have a percentage along pull back second inch long i have this two legged pullback very close to key entry point at the
(10:33) time when i was watching it i was coming off this key entry point so this is this high probability setup and this was the second trade that i took and this trade was slightly aggressive because you closed below ema you didn't trigger higher above this initial bar there was a little bearish correction and the signal bar is a doji bar okay it is close in the middle of this bar so when i took this trade i knew that i'm taking a slightly larger risk than normal and i sneaked in with limit order and this is how you want to play this is such a
(11:06) small signal bar and trading is about taking a chance your risk taker is traded it's about trading is a probabilities game so every single setup you enter you never know what is going to work or not you just follow the rules and the odds will work uh in the end you have odds on in your favor so there's a two legged pullback at the key entry point in a strong uptrend and this is definitely worth taking a chance here this one would have failed and look it felt and it took exactly the price where you thought it was gonna
(11:37) go initially and price formed another new low and when i was watching this i wasn't thinking about going along yet okay i i wasn't thinking about going along yet there was this big bullish bar but we closed below ema there was this bearish bar that closed building but there suddenly was this big bullish bar and we finally finally closed above the ema which is confirming the bullish momentum and this looks like a higher low setup we didn't technically close below this but this is a hidden first entry and this was where i re-entered and i
(12:09) was really kind of planning this setup i was really extremely focused because this was hard to pull the trigger because you're quite affected by the losing trade and now you're questioning yourself whether am i following the rules or am i just revenge trading the main point right here was was that there was a nice signal bar on a five-minute chart this was the signal bar that finished on a five-minute chart big bullish signal bar ema hold prices so once the signal bar finished this is where i entered on this bar this acts as a
(12:39) higher low setup because normally if you trigger lower and then reverse this would be a high low you don't have to trigger here it is a little bit hidden so this is a little bit advanced entry but it is still in the direction of the trend okay and maybe the trend my initial trend i was correct early and now we just have a break and a new extreme even though there are multiple ways to draw it and i'm still not really sure what is the correct way because it can easily be like that but market right now spiked and went into this channel is
(13:11) right now corrected by your below ema so you don't want to be buying anyway here we are buying because we are at the key entry point here we are not buying because price keeps pushing low and there is no key entry point for us to hang on so just focus on the shortened trend lines they will completely lead you where you need to go and yes hopefully you guys find the video useful i'm gonna see you guys the next one take care everybody





(270) 3 Important Tips How To Identify KEY LEVELS In Trading Ranges - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf-gs1kfJEE

Transcript:
(00:00) what is going on traders in today's video we're going to talk about three tips how to identify key levels in trading ranges normally on wednesdays i record my live trading session but today was fomc announcement day and this is very typical before the news market is extremely slow volume is slow so i didn't take any setups i was just sitting on my hands patiently baiting and after six hours i just couldn't force myself to record on camera i didn't even know i was about to take trades i managed to take this one trade
(00:27) right here and the last trade right here which was impulsive trade and i should have stayed away from this this late in the day but i managed to took these trades but overall these are the trades for today most of them are hindsight as i said because i wasn't really taking these trades as the lattice teams and really the market was overall very sideways so let's talk about the trading range tips all right so when it comes to trading ranges we need to understand that we want to buy low and sell high and we want to fade the breakouts
(00:56) because most breakouts of trading ranges will fail so you want to be always fading the breakouts meaning trading them in the opposite direction now the tip number one is going to be how do we identify the proper support and proper resistance now i'm just going to straight off the bat say that we don't use the stems if you guys take a look this is the stem this is the stem we don't use stems for identification of the key levels of trading ranges we use bodies we use closes all right and now tip number one we don't necessarily
(01:31) always want to use the completely the highest high or the lowest low okay this is the pre-market analysis ignore what you see on the right side because we've tried to locate the key levels before we start trading we're doing our pre-market analysis and i'm going to list all of the these three tips now and i'm going to show you more examples later so it will make more sense so when i see the highest point and highest point in the lowest point a lot of times you can deprive yourself of a few good setups so what i like to do i
(01:58) like to just sacrifice a few points in order for me to give have a little bit more confirmation so take a look i just drag a little bit higher and i have more confirmation with the price session right here i just drag it a little bit lower right here and i get confirmation right here and i get confirmation right here so this makes sense and more experience you will start to make sense and this is a skill like anything else drawing trend lines and identifying support and resistance it gets easier with time and
(02:25) with experience so this is what i've noticed this is just my experience how i usually do it if you completely use the highest or lowest point you can get no bounces off the key levels okay and the tip number two tip number two is how to draw the trend lines because in trading ranges and trading range is a mostly sideways movement when you're swinging up and up and down through ema your best bet and your safest bet is going to be using the shortened trend lines and really tight ones really the tight ones because they are the least subjective
(02:59) and the most objectives of them all they can only help you and why they can only help you because after you have a break in your extreme you're no longer looking for multiple new extremes because that's where the first line defense your shortened trend line is your best bet in trading ranges they will generate the most results now you can use slightly wider patterns there's nothing wrong with that what i'm want to say with this tip number two you don't really want to use for completely wide or flat patterns because
(03:26) i've noticed a lot of traders are doing this and um there's nothing you know wrong with this because i did the same thing and we all have the same tendency where we when we are starting trading until we you know market proves us otherwise some traders are looking at trendline something like this and take a look it fits off the highs it fits nicely off to low su look at see how many bounces you have but this is too flat this is too wide you don't want to use this this is a trading range structure this is completely sideways movement same thing
(03:55) right here you have a spike and the channel pattern and it may look valid like this there's nothing wrong with this but some traders they have the tendency to make it wider like this okay and this is not there's so much gap here so much gap here or even god forbid they can make it wider like this and this is extremely flat now there's a gap here there's a gap here it doesn't really fit price nicely it's swinging up and up and now this is more of a trading range like looking structure and this is not what you want
(04:25) to use in trading ranges okay let's talk about today because today was a perfect example you guys can see this is a clearly a consolidating structure take a look we're going sideways for the entirety of a day ema is completely flat part look at this down up down up down up down up down up and so forth so for so forth so this is a clearly a trading range structure so remember the first trend line the oldest one the first one you would see when you would first look at the chart is most likely the one that is the most valid you don't want to be
(04:57) making it wider like this wider like this wider like this or potentially wider like this because take a look you have multiple touches right here you can even make a case for it and it bounce okay so i'm not saying that the wider patterns are completely wrong because no there are of course a little wider patterns even in trading ranges but be aware of draw making the flatter and flatter and flatter because the danger is you can see a break and a new extreme and you can be tempted to still be looking for new low a new low or new
(05:31) high a new high and you'll be already getting trapped because you're on the wrong side of the market because the tighter trend line already played out so that's just the tip i've noticed throughout the experience how you want to focus on the trading ranges that your short term wants completely the best bet and yeah draw the uh we already talked about how to find support and resistance this was the pre-market open i don't want to use clothes stims like this i want to use closes and i have nice confirmation and i have
(05:57) a nice confirmation right here market eventually broke a little bit lower and yeah let's talk about tip number three so tip number three is and this is the least common you will get familiar with because this really doesn't happen too often but a lot of times you can have the tendency as the training range gets smaller and smaller you may want to draw this resistance a little bit lower or the support a little bit higher like this to make it fit and this is not really safe because a lot of times you can get a few breakouts
(06:27) and you would be tempted to fade them but they're going to work because what you want to do you still want to keep this where you would initially have it because these are your major key levels major key entry points and you kind of won't want it to make sense uh you kind of wanted to you know be around the trading range in the right proportion you don't want to draw it too low or resistance support too high because you can get you know few few fake outs and you can see this is the safest one so be a little bit leery of
(06:56) that of course you can have a small trading range inside of the train range so what you're going to do you're going to draw additional support or resistance so you can play safely at this one but you're going to keep your main ones intact because you don't want to keep your main ones something like this or something like this this is really not what you want to do you're already overshooting it shooting way too much and all right here we have another trading wrench example you guys can see here's the lowest low
(07:21) here's the stems i'm not going to use the stems i'm going to use closes but this is way too low and i can you know draw it a little bit higher just you know few more points to get the confirmation off of here it still confirms here and it works nicely so this is the main key entry point key level i can keep the support at the highest high because this is still a pre-market analysis because i have triple top i have multiple confirmation if i want to draw a little bit lower i would draw a way to here and this is
(07:48) obviously not making sense so i can use it at the highest high here because i have a confirmation and i don't want to use it a little bit necessarily right here even though this is so few points not really that big of a deal but from experience you will notice it is much better to have an additional experience additional confirmation once again you want to use shorter term trend lines that are your best bet you don't want to be looking for something like this because why up down up down up down up down this is a
(08:15) trading looking structure you're going really wide and you don't want to be using these larger patterns because this is just trading range structure this is too flat okay everything else every single time when it's starting to get too flat uh you have to be a little bit more careful okay it can work in some cases but we're trying to get odds on our favor and we want to stick with the shorter ones they are your best bet once again if i draw a little bit higher leg here this is the tip number three uh you have a few breakouts even though it worked
(08:45) for scalps those breakouts eventually get broken lower but if you keep it at lows right here you guys can see this is the major key level this is the major failed breakout and price eventually broke higher because field breakouts like here and like here they generate a lot of time strong momentum to get in completely other side of the range once again trading range right here i can do i can use the lowest lows right here but that's not really it doesn't really um is too useful because it's too low i can just draw it a little bit higher to get
(09:18) more confirmation uh i don't want to use the highest high here because take a look at how few confirmations i get here so i just want to drag it a little bit lower or in this instance i actually don't want to drag because this feels kind of too low although this is not too bad either i can get the confirmation right here yeah this actually makes sense if i just draw it way too low this is already way too low for my liking so this could be good enough uh to confirm it with here confirm it here this was the field breakout once again
(09:47) sticking with the mainly shorter-tuned trend lines i don't want to use wider trend lines like this even though um i mean it can you can make a case for it it can be useful but most often than not you don't want to be looking for wider patterns you're mostly going want to be looking for the uh shorter ones okay so let me see if there is and there is no okay you don't want to be doing the wider and wider because that's already way too flat and your best bet is to be sticking with the shorter two ones they're always the
(10:24) safest ones in trading ranges okay this here's the lowest low but i don't want to use it because there's such a gap so i want to get a little bit more confirmation and when it comes to resistance i can use the highest high here and why can i use the highest high here because there is no prior point of reference for confirmation okay because i would have to draw it all the way down here to get the confirmation this is already the tip number three that you want to stay away from so you can use the highest high or
(10:51) the lowest low if there is no you know close points for confirmation and once again you don't want to draw it way too high up like this or way too low like this because here you would have a breakout and this is not really a fail breakout yet because the proper key entry point is down here all right here we have another example what i could do i could use the stems but i'm not going to use that stems are no good i can use the lowest low i'm just going to drag it a little bit higher so i get a little bit more confirmation i'm going to use
(11:25) the highest high because if i found more confirmation i'm already way too low so that's not what i want to do i want to use a little bit higher like this and once again i'm going to stick with the shortened trend lines something like this and what i don't want to be doing i don't want to be doing this or this or this this is just too flat just too wide an overall structure is really going sideways ema is flat we're going up and down up and down and if you guys take a look here uh yeah and you don't want to draw a little bit lower
(12:00) like this because you're already making it way too tight and this is not really what you want to do you want to keep your key level static and where it makes sense and you know this is how you should do it uh and this is how i've been doing it for most of my career now all right and here's the last example let's take a look at the pre-market structure analysis uh in this instance i can use the lowest lows why because i have a double bottom confirmation so i can confirm it and it you know makes sense this is a common sense it looks
(12:30) like a valid trading range it really you know contains the price nicely and i'm not going to use the highest high right here even though it's not bad i'm definitely not going to use stims but if i just drag it a little bit lower i get more confirmation right here more confirmation right here this is really making the price nicer i'm going to do i'm going to use the shorter turn trend lines they're the much safer ones and i'm not going to be looking for really flat patterns even though there is probably this one could be helpful you guys can
(13:04) see you have multiple higher highs higher lows working higher but you can see this is a bullish imbalance and once you're starting to be getting close to this resistance um do you really want to be trading this you know i would say it is much better to wait for price to actually break higher for option to start and from that point on it is much better to be looking for uh second entry longs with the trend section along here second second inch along here second long here second along here so just something to think about
(13:35) you can use a little bit wider patterns but when you're looking for two flat patterns uh they're not really too useful because you can follow the shortened trend lines you can still get to the same place much safer okay every bit experience you will get the feel how to do it properly alright so i'm gonna wrap it up and talk to you next time take care buddy

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on traders in today's video we're going to talk about trend lines and key levels we're going to talk about why they are so important and how to draw them and find them correctly because a lot of beginner traders they think that trend lines and key levels are much more subjective than they really are and in reality that's not really the case because after a few years of studying price action and studying the chart immersing yourself in it you will start seeing a lot of similarities and there is a specific
(00:27) type of way how trend lines can be found and how key levels can be found that i'm going to share with you guys today and hopefully it will clear a few things up now the market and these scandals they're always you know in some sort of trend even in trading ranges they're just tiny micro trends up and micro trends down but this is the reason why we want to draw the trend lines market geometry is very real and trend lines allow us to find and predict where the market is most likely going to be heading because a lot of times
(01:00) price is bouncing off certain areas and without the proper line we have no idea why the price is bouncing off these areas we even have the 21 bar exponential moving average on the chart which helps us to identify the direction but there's a reason why price keeps turning from these points we cannot move the market we're following institutions and we want to use every single tool we have now we're going to start with the big pattern to big trend lines the bigger the biggest trend line is the strongest key entry point and takes
(01:31) precedence and every single time i'm drawing the trend line i have a few things that i keep in mind and how do i draw the trend lines normally you will draw your bigger trend lines off the first two swings alright so let's take a look right here as we have a move up move down and move up price resembles a trading range structure but there is a bullish bias we keep making higher lows so i'm going to draw locate the bigger trend line so what i can do i can draw a trend line like this use first two swings put it at the top
(02:08) and i see a structure like this so when i'm drawing my bigger trend lines i'm looking for the bigger patterns i always keep two things in mind how long it's going to take for price to get all the way up to here all the way down here is it even reasonable you know i'm going to be waiting multiple hours for price to get all the way up to here to down here and if price makes it make it all the way up down here by the time this correction is going to be way too strong it may even be a you know brand new downtrend and i'm
(02:37) probably going to get trapped down here so every single time the trend is starting to look too flat and starting to look too much like a trading range that's when i'm starting to get really cautious because what i want to do i want to draw my trend lines steep because that's how trends are trends are not supposed to be flat they're supposed to be steep they're supposed to be going higher in one direction and take a look how this much this makes sense much more i can make it all the way down to here in a few minutes and even the correction
(03:06) down to this trend line is going to be reasonable there's still going to be a strong bullish bias so this is what i keep in mind and the same thing to the downside i can use first two swings but i have to ask myself is this too flat how long it's going to take for price to get all the way up to here is it does it make sense all right if pricing if price makes all the way up to here it probably going to be way too bullish and you know that's not really going to be helpful so this is what i keep in mind i don't want to draw it too flat i
(03:38) want to draw it reasonable and this is how i do it now a lot of times you will not be able to find the trend lines from the swings with the direction of a trend meaning a lot of times you'll be able to find a trend line from the lows if you're looking for uptrend and from the highs if you're looking for downtrend but there's a little tip i'm going to share with you a lot of times you can find the trend lines before everybody else if you look for the trend lines from the upper side let's say in uptrend as you guys can see i will find a trendline
(04:11) of these highs copy it put it down here and i can see that i can get the bounces all the way up to here all right so not every single time you're going to be looking for trend lines off the lows keep an eye how market geometry is reflecting at the top of your trend line you will just copy it put it at the bottom and you will be able to predict where the price is going to bounce up here okay now since we're talking about bigger patterns what can happen is when the trend is strong and it's a strong trend a lot of times the
(04:44) corrections are so weak the buying power is so strong that you will not even get it and make it down to this key entry point and that's okay you still want to have the bigger pattern on the chart because it serves as a bias confirmation you want to remind yourself that the bias is strongly still bullish and you're still willing to be looking for reasons to go along okay so this can happen during strong trends a lot of times it will not even come into play or you have it here just for the bias confirmation now
(05:14) let's talk about the shortened trend lines because this is where traders really struggle they they're mistaking whether they should draw the trend line tight or slightly wider and we need to understand that once there is a bigger trend established i'm going to draw every micro every counter correction i'm going to draw the micro tight steep all right so if there is a bullish option working higher and i see a bunch of downtrends what i'm not going to do i am not going to draw wide like this even though this can still make it
(05:54) a little bit safe and keep you away from few bad setups you will deprive yourself of a lot of high probability setups if you keep playing it like this all right same thing up here i'm going to draw it tight like this because right now this is a bush correction part of the bearish downtrend i'm not going to draw it wide like this because i'm going to deprive myself of a possible good entry once again we have a very downtrend working lower i'm not going to draw it like this i'm going to draw it tight like this because the overall pattern is down and
(06:31) this is just a correction all right let's take a look at this uptrend i already have a bunch of them drawn right here so i'm just going to quickly delete them and what i'm not going to be doing drawing them wide like this i will completely get rid of every single opportunity to buy remember the bigger pattern takes precedence and the trend is up and i'm looking for reasons to go along so i just want to make it tight enough so i can see when there is a break and a new extreme all right there's a break new extreme right here
(07:12) there is a nice break and new extreme down here this is why we look for trend lines because after there's a break an attempt to create a new extreme that's how we know that the downtrend played out cells are no longer in control and we are safe to be looking to go long okay so this is why and where we are looking to make him tight now you can see that you have a break and attempt to make a new low you don't have a new extreme and is that okay yes a lot of times the trend is going to be so strong that you're going to only
(07:43) get an attempt for price to create a new extreme and close is close enough in price action you will never get anything 100 perfect sometimes it's going to be a little bit unclear and since there is a strong bigger key entry point price just cannot push it lower all right there's a lot of buyers in here so you have attempt to create new stream and that's enough same thing same thing up here you have a downturn working lower you have a break your first attempt to create a new extreme pullback higher second attempt to create a new extreme
(08:15) and it failed two failed attempts is the second entry short with the direction of a bullish trend this is going to be a trap because second entry with the direction of a trend is a high probability setup this is the second entry against the trend same thing up here there is a new low first entry short pullback second attempt to sell failed above the ema with the direction of a trend all right so this is a high probability setup because it's second entry short against the bullish long trend so keep them tight don't widen them too much with the
(08:48) direction of a trade you will deprive yourself of a lot of good setups all right and trent ema is going to be so strong chad is going to be so strong a lot of times you will not get the clear break a lot of times you will you have a clear break clear new extreme cookie cutter easy price action setup doesn't get much easier than this all right but a lot of times you can get attempt to make a new low and that's going to be enough now where do we draw them a little bit wider we draw them wider basically when it's
(09:14) unsure what the pattern is and when we expect a reversal we also i'm going to still mention a little bit the tight ones in trading ranges you almost always want to follow the tight trend lines all right so let's take a look at this it's going to be a little bit different here because the structure is spike in a channel we have a spike we have a channel we have overshoot and overshoot a lot of times lead to a break of a trendline or straight up reversal so when i see this i expect reversal for the market because
(09:45) this is not a correction this is there is no bigger pattern yet this is looking like a range-like structure so what i'm not going to do i'm not going to draw it like this what i'm going to do i'm going to draw it like this i'm going to make it slightly wider and i have a break new extreme which indicates that the downtrend played out at the same time i'm not going to draw the trend line like this this would indicate that this bullish correction is part of a bearish downtrend it's not the case here i have to draw a little bit wider like
(10:18) this because this is a new trend in itself that it's starting after this downtrend played out all right this trend is not part of bigger downturn so i'm going to draw it a little bit wider like this when it comes to shortened trend lines we can draw shortened trend lines with the direction of a trend and i'm not too fan of this now that it is not useful it i mean it can only help us to draw the shortened trend lines with the direction of a larger pattern but it's not really going to give us results as we are looking for because if
(10:55) you draw the shortened trend lines with the direction of a trend you will keep making new extremes new extremes new extremes and it kind of lacks the value of why we are looking for trend lines we look for trends because you want to see a break new low we want to see that the downturn played out if we're going to keep drawing the trend lines with the direction of a trend it can only help us i mean it cannot hurt us but you know it's not really going to produce you know good powerful results because a lot of times the there is not going to
(11:23) be high probability set up at the shortened trend lines because high priority setups happen at the key entry point ema or the larger pattern you cannot have a high probability set up far away from key entry points at the very top of the moves all right so i know a lot of traders like drawing the shortened trend lines with the direction of a trend me personally i think it's a little bit redundant i like to keep my child clean i like to focus on the bigger pattern and on the corrections that's all i need another
(11:51) exponential moving average so that's when it comes to shortened trend lines with the direction of a trend now let's talk about the overshoot overshoot is a break of a trend line but with the direction of a trend this is an uptrend and we broke with the direction of a trend to the upside this is the downtrend we broke with the direction of a trend to the downside all right overshoot is unnatural activity in the market and it leads to breakover trendline or possibly straight up reversal and that can mess up with
(12:21) the trendline rules because after price will break the trend line traders will attempt to create a new extreme but when it comes to overshoot you can have straight up reversal without break and a new extreme and this is crucial this is what you need to keep in mind when you see overshoot because you can be stuck on the wrong side of the market all right so just take a look at today was really unusual we had a massive move up overshoot to the upside massive move down at the same time overshoot to the downside
(12:49) this really doesn't happen too often you had an overshoot right here to the upside a massive sell-off so weird day when it comes to overshoots but let's talk about overshoot and larger pattern when it comes to shortened trend lines overshoot is a no-brainer you cannot probably mistake it but when it comes to larger pattern when you have overshoot and you keep overshooting you're basically thinking about is this overshoot valid or is the bigger pattern and big trend strong that there is no overshoot and in this instance
(13:20) this is what i did we had a trend line like this and we kept overshooting kept overshooting so i put it at the top like this and i made it slightly larger because i was betting at the bullish option same thing down here i made a trend line like this because i was betting at the downtrend and it was not correct why because i don't have any prior point of reference any swing that would confirm at least one i need at least one and it should be the second i need some sort of confirmation at the top i have no confirmation down here and
(13:49) this can really lead to taking setups at these points which is not the way you want to do it because you i really should have been treating it as an overshoot and when it comes to this downturn it's pretty hard to find the downtrend i'm going to do it i'm going to use a two-tiered measure i'm going to use the measure thing i'm going to treat this as overshoot shorten trendline break new extreme and price never look bad it can actually look back all the way down here but this is what overshoot are doing keep in mind
(14:19) that they can completely reverse the market right now let's talk about key levels how do we look for key levels because what we can be doing we can let's say we can mark hill right here we can find killer up here we can find key level up here and we can find kilo up here and if you're going to be doing this you're going to go nuts because you could be doing this the entire day and that's not really the way to do it as intraday scalpers the only key level you need to pay attention to is the one you would find during your pre-market
(14:59) analysis you might you mark your low for the day and you mark your high for the day and the reason why we look for key levels is because most breakouts from these key levels are going to fail you never want to buy the breakout in this breakout phase you want to wait for price pull back because most breakouts will fail and you want to buy the breakout pullback or the cell so remember never trade with the direction of a breakout in this breakout phase wait for the pullback most breakouts of trading ranges and from these key levels
(15:31) are going to fail that's number one number two a lot of times price will retest these areas throughout the day you guys can see this is the key level price broke strong at the key level pull back all the way up to this key level this is a breakout pullback pattern retest of this breakout area and it gave you a high probability setup and all you need is to mark your key level during your pre-market analysis same thing you mark this low right here and it comes into play all this late you're far away from ema you have
(16:09) overshoot and you touch to the very take the key level this is why price is bouncing here okay all right this is the tool that you can use to help you to predict the trades the key level is respecting the a right here this is looking like a wedge pattern you don't want to be trading taking trades in this i took the second entry along right here new high first century long second inch along i really was supposed to be sitting on my hands because i don't like taking trades in the wedge but look what happened it stopped you out and it took
(16:37) off exactly where you thought it was gonna go first central second inch long failure failure they trapped so many shots here and it was a nice trap but that's sometimes what happens in trading but no big deal all right so remember key levels you don't have to be looking for key levels during the day your pre-market analysis is going to produce high for the day and low for the day important key levels of course the price is going to be creating strong support and resistance throughout the day of course you're going to market but
(17:07) you don't have to be worrying too much about it all right so if i take a look at this day i'm going to mark my key levels up here and down here what i can see the price broke higher pull back and came back all the way down here to retest the breakout area and remember it is not a single line it is an area on the chart this is a retest of the breakout area and all you had to do is find the key level during your premark analysis lows didn't come into play alright doesn't matter the heist came into play let's take a look a previous day i'm
(17:43) going to mark my highs for today i'm going to my mark my lows for the day highs for today are reacting price is turning down low for the day support is forming breakout area price pulls back re-test this breakout area and it gives you a high probability setup and all you have to do is mark your low for the day high four day during your pre market analysis and you don't have to keep worried about multiple key levels on the chart because i see it a lot of traders especially in forex they mark 20 key levels on a chart
(18:17) and they're wondering why the trades are failing i'm going to mark my kill up here key level down here let's say you guys can see price is reacting to this key level and reacting to this kilo at the bottom here i'm going to mark the lows i'm going to mark the highs heist didn't really come into play but the lows strong breakout retest of the breakout area this is what you need the key level it will come into play once again i'm going to draw the key levels up here and it came into play all the way down here but you're far away from ema you're
(19:06) overshooting the downtrend and this is where the price is bouncing it helps you to locate the high probability areas all right i don't like having a thick lines like that one shot i will draw these thin lines so i can have a nice clear chart alright so this was additional video about trend lines hopefully it was useful you guys can see we have overshoot which leads to break of a trendline or possible straight up reversal you guys can see you have a downtrend you have a break new extreme i'm going to draw my corrections my correction wider i'm
(19:46) not going to draw it tight like this why am i not going to draw a tag like this because you already have a break and the new extreme i even like trend line a little bit tighter like this all right so i'm going to draw a little bit wider you have a break attempt to create a new stream and you just now created a new extreme and we're bouncing off the important key level which is not even today all right so if the video was useful it's a like button subscribe to the channel and i'm gonna see you guys in the next one take care everybody

(00:00) traders welcome to youtube video and in this video we're going to talk about how to trade ranges following the price action rules because if you're going to follow the price action rules you're going to stay on the right side of the market and you're not going to give in to your mental demons they are trying to play tricks on you while you are trading trading ranges you guys can see i have this 21 bar ema exponential moving average this is the indicator that you want to plot in on your chart and it's going to have a specific use within a trading range this is just a supportive
(00:31) indicator we are mainly relying on the candlesticks on the chart so the first thing you want to see and do when you're trading in trading ranges you want to mark and identify the highs for the day or the lows for the day this these are your key levels and price will most often than not pay attention to these key levels and price will react around the ski levels so when i see that the day is starting to look like a trading range the most of touches i get is when i use this key level right here i could use the key level right here and put it at the very top but there is a little bit of a room and that doesn't
(01:04) feel great i want to use as many touches as i have and remember this is just a zone this is not like one thin line you just keep it in mind that there is some resistance right here so i'm just going to copy it i'm going to put it at the bottom and the best thing is to put it right here where i have a double confirmation right off the gecko i can see that this is a healthy trading range there is no imbalance what does it mean this is a healthy trading range price goes from the one extreme to the other and from the top to the bottom from the bottom to
(01:34) the top this means that this is a healthy trading range and this is no imbalance is present here because all the extremes are being nicely met and fulfilled all right during these training ranges you want to draw the shortened trend lines they are your best and only reliable tool you're going to have so you're going to draw the shortened trend lines because you want to follow the trendline rule which says after price will break the trend line traders will attempt to create a new extreme so as i see price working higher and
(02:03) working lower this is a healthy trading range if you need to plot those uh plot the new high and new low text on the chart to help you identify where you have a new low or where you have a new extreme so i can see that i have a trend line working here i have a break i have a new extreme form so someone just gonna copy it put it at the top and i can identify this is a new extreme and i expect from this point on i expect correction or straight up reversal i have a break i have a new extreme so what do i expect i'm going going to mark new low and i expect
(02:34) correction or straight up reversal and this is where the ema comes in handy because once price pushes strongly above the ema and i have two felt attempts in the previous transdirection this is going to be a reversal pattern so use these if you need to see the mark clearly i have an option working higher i have a break and i have a new extreme so i'm just going to copy it put it at the top and once again what do i expect i expect correction or straight up reversal while you're drawing these trend lines you need to resist the urge to draw
(03:04) these trend lines wider you don't want to be doing something like this this is not even that bad but you don't know you don't want to be doing something like this this is not how trading range operates you don't want to be doing something like this most often than not and trading is about probability your best bet is to stick with the tighter steeper trend line so you can clearly see the breaks a new low and you guys can see how it really works in ranges because price will just react off of these key levels and you need to stay on the right side of the market so this is still the pre-market open area
(03:37) and market is about to open very soon market actually opens somewhere around this point right here so as the market is pushing down from this resistance the according to rules you expect for price to reach from the here all the way down here but now you need to catch a safe and good entry and you guys can see you have a big bearish move down you're pushing below ema which confirms the bearish momentum and now when you're going to sell you're going to sell when you see a two failed attempts in the previous trends direction the previous trend was bullish
(04:09) this was the last bullish move that retested resistance and once you push below any bullish move up is going to be a trap you push below ema and you're coming from one side to the other so in since i know that any move is going to be a trap i'm looking for a high probability setup and high probability setup is going to be a second entry because to like a pullback a second entry that's how market moves it's tied down to human psychology when humans try to do something once they they don't just quit they try to do it again and after they do it twice and fail that's
(04:41) when they give up you guys can see there's the new extreme form price push below ema and there's the first attempt to go along above this bullish bar it ticked all the orders and instantly reversed on them and sold off so this was the first attempt to buy that failed there's another bar that we ticked above so new entry is form is the second attempt to go long but you don't want to go long after birch move down while you're heading down here and while you're below this ema and this is the second entry shot long that felt and
(05:08) reverse it off the exponential moving average this is a high probability setup this is the felt second entry long in the direction of a downtrend and you're heading all the way down to these lows and once again i can draw the trend line either super tight like this this is how i had it real time or you can draw it like this this is still very tight and this is still okay you all you need to think about the don't drum too white and you expect for price to go all the way down here so this is the first high probability setup you expect the reversal pattern is your go-to setup in trading ranges after
(05:39) price has a break and in your extreme i created multiple videos on reversal patterns price is pushing lower and once you see this big move down your brain is telling you and pushing signals into your brain that you need to be selling take a look at this downtrend you don't want to miss out you don't want to be buying such a strong downtrend that's the common sense that you use in real life and it make you probably a lot of good decisions in real life but in trading you have to get rid of it in trading you have to use the price action since the trading
(06:11) center you have to throw common sense out of the window because during trading ranges you have to understand that most breakouts will fail there is going to be one breakout that will eventually work but most breakouts of trading ranges will fail at least temporarily all right you never want to buy the breakout in this breakout phase you always want to wait for the breakout pull back if anything but mostly you want to fade these breakouts fading means you want to fade take the trade in the opposite direction of a breakout so there's the downturn working lower i have a break
(06:40) and i have a new extreme form for the downturn so i'm going to do the same thing i'm going to mark the new low so i know that i can expect correction or straight up reversal and especially reversal because i'm below the support and below key level and most breakouts will fail this is now a failed breakout however this is a little bit aggressive because you never know how many pushes down you're going to make but here is when it comes really the exponential moving average handy because this is why you have it on your chart the further away you're from exponential moving average
(07:10) especially in trading ranges the higher likelihood there is you're going to pull back so once you see the gap between ema being large and during ranges below the the support during the failed breakout you can expect there's a really high chance the price will pull back at least a little bit you're not predicting long-term market movement you're predicting a very short moment so this could be a decent entry if you know what you're doing if you're advanced but here's what gets interesting there's the new extreme form
(07:38) and there's the first attempt to sell below this bearish bar pull back higher second attempt to sell this is a two legged pullback under normal circumstances second entry short with the direction of a trend would be a high probability setup but this is not a trend this is a range this downtrend played out with the new low and you're expecting for this breakout to fail and go all the way up to here this is what you're expecting there's no imbalance yet there is no imbalance yet so it's okay for you to be buying at this point on you have to suppress the common sense
(08:07) and use the price action rules there's the first century short second entry short failure you have room to ema big bullish bar this is a high probably set up my first attempt for the day i missed it because it gapped up instantly but this is how you're focusing on these ranges you're just fading these breakouts buying lows and selling highs so i'm going to do i'm going to draw the shortened trend lines again i see price pushing above the ema and pushing back the low so this is confusing because if this is a healthy trading range the support is going to hold ema is going to hold and it's not
(08:39) holding price pushed back below so you're just sitting on your hands the downtrend can resume the breakout eventually can broke to the downside you don't know that you don't have a crystal ball so you're just sitting on your hands but take a look what happens there's the first entry short trigger lower and pushing strong above the ema already a good sign that the balls are really active from this fail breakout and there is a second entry short second attempt to sell the market below this bar and it ticked everybody in one take and it is on the reverse high
(09:10) probability pattern similar pattern to this but this is now a reversal pattern because the downtrend played out with the brake at a new low this is not the reversal pattern because reversal pattern has to push above ema it even though it is a failed two attempts these are two felt attempts in the previous direction which was bearish but now you're above the ema plus you're above the key level that you mark at the beginning of your session you see how it's going to come into play market get working higher kept working higher now you're getting into middle of
(09:38) trading range and you want to be careful trading in the middle of trading range unless it is a reversal pattern reversal pattern is the only exception you want to use i was looking at it even like this which is not something what i was supposed to do i i was supposed to cheat it like a major two legs up the up jump played out so this is how you really want to focus on the move up from this field breakout and this is where the market opened and this is where it got a little bit undecisive you don't want to go long below ema like this
(10:08) and you don't want to go short at the same time because the support is right here and you're going short uh directly into the support so even though it is tempting to take a few shorts here market is undecisive you're hovering around this key level just wait until market gives you a clear direction and market push back above the support and give you a first century short pullback second entry short this is the same pattern as you have right here so you're just focusing on the high probability patterns two felt attempts in the previous trends
(10:38) direction you guys can see you have a [Music] first move down pull back sort of like a second move down two legs down now this is this is now still part of this overall consolidation the ema is still flat this was not that easy to take in real time our market because it only looks good in hindsight but if you take a look at this like this you're quite you know working in a sideways consolidation this is a micro trading range within the trading range so this is quite hard to take so you can take it if you recognize if you
(11:10) really know what you're doing i'm going to mark it but you're still expecting because it's a healthy trading range go from this point all the way up to here so you're going to draw the shortened trend lines so they will keep you on the right side of the market and you guys can see you're pushing higher you have a little bit of overshoot which means if you get the setup at the trendline you're not taking it because market will break the trend line most likely or straight up reverse however this is extremely strong uptrend now and you expect following the
(11:40) trend trading range rules for the market to go all the way up to here and now your this is now a trend and you want to buy the second entry with the direction of a trend and you have a new extreme form and you have a first pullback to go long that failed and it's okay because these are not reliable and you have a second entry long where at the key entry point also i have a downtrend a little bit i do it like this i kind of have a break in your stream i'm drawing this really tight in this situation because the major trend is up and this is just a
(12:15) correction and for corrections you draw a tight this was my first trade for the day that i took and this was a losing trade you're still expecting a new low new height to be formed according to trendline rules break of a trend line you expect new height to be formed and you're playing the range rules you expect new extreme it ticked it filled me in it took one tick higher or a few ticks and it instantly reversed in like two or three seconds and i it cooked me instantly go on just like that so this is my first straight and first losing trade and i
(12:43) have to but i have to follow the rules i cannot cherry pick even though you can tell there's little nuances you can tell how far the body is away from ema there's still a little bit gap it just doesn't feel right but a trader cannot cherry pick i took this trade right here once this bar formed and this is now a legit second entry long you know that the odds are still high that you're going to make a new stream this is where i re-entered and you're going to see i even re i even added on right here because this is now a second entry long and take a look what you have you have a
(13:13) push above ema ema keeps holding price so key entry point is holding with the direction of the trend and this is a higher low high low is a confirmation but two like a pullback i added on another set so i was holding 12 contracts at this point on it got quite scary it was a quick easy scalp of both positions and then i took a failed second entry short all right so this was a this was a no joke this was today uh four trades within like five minutes even less because this is the lowest low and there's a first century short pullback
(13:44) second entry short but you don't have a new extreme form yet you're not at the top yet ema holds price you're not thinking about selling this is a high priority setup people are going to get trapped going short and this is very similar to a trade i took live uh two days ago came from the lows we're heading to the highs there's a strong uptrend working higher and this is why i took this trade today there's a new high first century long pullback second entry long ema is holding and there is a high low setup you guys can see
(14:16) high low and you're still expecting for price to give you a new extreme difference here is that felt secondary short was a big bar that already pushed way too high up and you only can enter probably on the engulfing bar which you don't want to anyway but you're you're now have triple top right here so you have to be careful but it is very similar and this is why i took the trade today so this was a but this second entry long was tricky it instantly cooked me it is what it is this price section sometimes they stop you just one take and this is
(14:43) nothing you can do to avoid you can feel a little bit nuance here but um it's 50 50. half of the traders will skip this half of traders will take it so if you took it you follow the rules and nothing wrong so once again what i'm going to do i'm going to copy it i have a break i have a new high which tells me that the uptrend is over i'm at the top of a trading range and what do i expect correction or straight up reversal all right and ema can hold price this is why you have the email on the chart if price keeps above ema you're not selling we can make additional like up all right and that's
(15:18) important but take a look once again first entry long push below ema indicating best momentum same thing right here second entry long failure textbook repeat pattern of this textbook repeat pattern of this felt second attempt in the previous trans direction you have a move too far you're right below ema high probability setup reversal pattern this is how you trade trading ranges you see this big move up and you want to keep buying you you're thinking oh let me take a look there's a little bit of a micro bottom let me just go along on the second entry long right here in a in a
(15:52) pullback no option played out with the break in your stream and in ranges you go from one extreme to the to another suppress your common sense the market will reward you this is why you have the price action rules in play they shield you from uh using common sense all right now as i can see market is pushing lower i have a break and i have a new low unfortunately on the market way down there is no two-legged pullback there is no setup like this that would allow me to sell that will allow me to sell the two-legged pullback just like i bought two like a pullback up and these were high priority setup there is no setup
(16:29) that allowed me just bunch of first entries that are working and take a look what you have you have a break and a new low near the support so i'm just going to do the same thing mark it put it here i have a new low so i expect correction or straight up reversal i have another leg down oh what is this this is not a correction or straight up rehearsal but sometimes you can get two legs to the extreme that's okay i'm just gonna move the support a little bit lower because it it may have moved the support and resistance can move with more price action it's completely normal and you
(17:00) don't have to get a little bit stressed about it so if if i have a two legs to a new stream now i for sure expect correction or reversal so i have move up but i have a strong rejection of the ema and already something is different here every single time prior to this after breaking a new low price instantly reversed and there was no rejection of ema here or there was a little bit of rejection of ema here but we instantly ran up higher take a look what is here you have a rejection of ema you get a high low setup which is attempting to go long because you have a two legs down
(17:35) you have push higher and you have a high low set up i will mark it as a slightly advanced trade for more advanced traders watching because you have two legs down and the support is holding but take a look you have move up and another rejection of the ema so this is no longer a reversal this is really starting to look like ema is struggling to keep price pushing above so you keep watching you have a triple bottom it's starting to get a little bit wedgie you can start to identify the channel that is working lower and but you don't
(18:05) want to take no longer you don't want to take no short into this low and you can see price is pushing higher and you have a triple rejection of ema and this is telling you something if this is a healthier trading range you're going from you're going to go from lows back to the highs this is what you're expecting but it's not happening here it seems like there's going to there's a little bit of a bullish imbalance because one two three four touches of exponential moving average are preventing from price to go above and this is not what you want to see this is
(18:35) now indicating strong base momentum and this is how this is a clue you now start to understand that you may push lower and this is where you know that you don't no longer want to be fading the breakouts so there are clues from the market it will give you so you can understand where it is okay to fade the breakout and when it's not so once you see ema holding like this you're making lower highs lower lows every single time you just let the market go you're not fading the breakout you're pushing the ema you have it just first entry this was a decent entry
(19:06) because this is now a for sure like a fifth or fourth confirmation of this channel and this is a breakout pullback pattern two three key entry points are holding yeah i gotta mark this as a high probability setup because this is a gorgeous signal bar full on bearish trendline holds ema holds support holds now as a resistance breakout pullback this and you guys can see even during the bearish imbalance phase which is a bearish bias even the breakouts still pull back but you don't want even when the breakout is working you still want to wait for a pullback that's the safest way you trade the breakouts a market pushed lower and now you're getting a
(19:41) little bit away from the trading range so you are switching the rules you abandon the trading range and you stick with the trend so you're looking for second entry shorts like here with the direction of a trend but you don't get no second entry shorts you're just sitting on your hand patiently you have a strong reverse a strong overshoot this was such a substantial overshoot i actually enlarged my channel something like this i thought this is going to be a two-tier two-tier channel but still this was a very oversold even though i treat it as
(20:10) a two-tier this was a very oversold category and something is telling you here that it's not the best thing to keep looking for second entry shorts this is most likely how you're gonna get trapped also what you can do you can measure this you can copy it put it at the bottom and we already talked about it in our last lesson and you can find a two-tiered trading range and you guys can see this is where something this is where price came into play it's this is a two-tier trading range so measured moves doesn't don't only work for the lags it even works for two-tier trading ranges
(20:47) and you're going to draw the shortened trend line in trends as well because these corrections still need to play out so you have a second entry short of the key entry point however you have the short term trendline in play i'm not a big fan of this especially when really looking back this is such a clear channel this was an overshoot an overshoot leads to a break of a trendline or possibly reversal and if you see the measured move you definitely expect a strong bullish momentum working here now ema gets flat ema gets in the middle of those bars and i don't like any entry
(21:17) this is no entry area one two three four five six seven bar stacked you get a lower high here but a close above you don't have a new high for this uptrend you have overshoot you're coming from here easy to get a trick here i guarantee some of you probably took a short here but uh really risky and dangerous situation to go short here but take a look what you have you have a double trap here you have a new low first entry short pull back second entry short that failed and it's and also there is a oh oh it
(21:52) technically probably worked it managed to reach the scalper's profit and even this felt second entry short reached the scalper's profit so technically it didn't failed but we can treat it as a failure because you traders expect for move to be more substantial so we have failed second entry short that stopped everybody out who went short they kept their buy stops right here and everybody went long here it just got trapped suckered in so this is a double trap it's a first break of this downtrend and you're expecting a new extreme to be formed this is a decent trade i still
(22:23) you know would prefer for you to be patient here respect this no trade area respect the ema flat in the middle of those bars respect the overshoot but you can identify what's going on here it's not a bad entry you create additional move up and what i can do i can measure the overshoot it's going to copy it and this leads me a little bit right here i'm just going to put it here yeah that's a little bit okay so i can expect that the overshoot is done i still expect new extreme to be formed after this break of a downtrend price action trendline rules and i have a
(22:56) first century long pullback second entry long failure the reversal pattern below ema i'm expecting you low to be form last trade my trade for the day high probability setup a market push lower create a double bottom which can be considered close enough to a new extreme so i'm going to mark it you still can you still are expecting additional leg down but you don't have it you adapt to the market you have not the market you want and you're just pushing strongly higher so you have to once again keep drawing the
(23:30) trend lines i actually even drew there a little bit of a trading range because this really looked so much like like a range like struck structure you're expecting price price to go from one end to the other but there's a strong move higher there's a trend line in presence so you cannot sell the high here because you don't have that you're not that far from the exponential moving average and this trend line is intact take a look every single time you're fading the breakouts you have a break in a new low or you have a break at a new high so if
(23:58) the trend line is intact you're just sitting on your hands patiently ema is pointing higher and ema keeps holding price every single time there ended up being after you get more confirmation like this there ended up being a channel like this and once this is a uptrend channel you now tr use the same rules as you did right here you're looking for second entry longs because it's a high probability set up second entry long at the key entry point you want to go long here it's a high probably the setup same thing right here but you don't get this i'm going to draw my trend line
(24:33) i have a first century long pull back second entry long above bearish doji if i want to go long i want to see a bullish momentum bar at least somewhat bullish not this indecision candle with the bearish body the close at the level or even slightly below the ema it's questionable it looks like it's at the level that's not a good entry and reason for me to go long here and this is once again double trap first inch long second entry long failure everybody who went long got stopped out they went long too early they done they jumped the gun too quickly and everybody who felt they
(25:11) trapped everybody going long and felt second entry long they got suckered in and gay instantly got trapped so this is a double trap however bar is still bad i still don't like it that much the only advanced trader can if you can recognize really well the double trap you can take it and and then you get a new low and you get a high low at this point on since i already took one two three four five trades for today i was done with trading i didn't want to push my luck and i'm glad that i did because i probably have
(25:42) taken this higher low and i like it i'm going to mark it if you took it i think you did well because you have a break of this uptrend and you expect a new extreme to be formed take a look how strong this uptrend was it's completely rational to be expecting rules to get a new extreme if i move it to right side of the chart yeah the only thing is that you fought one two three four five bar stacked and ema is getting in the middle of those bars and that's the problem that's the there's the congestion that's starting to form here
(26:10) which congestion is a no trade zone that's that's what you what would have kept you out of this trade just not overlooking great but still you're expecting your extreme form ema looks like it's holding you know decent trade decent trade to take a chance on a market push lower and here it is where it got really confusing and this is why you want to be done early you don't want to push the luck because you can get stacked into this you you can give back all what you made so always take your two three winning trades or even one once you start to
(26:40) feel uncomfortable like you're pushing trades you're forcing trades don't gamble take your one winning trade take your two winning trades go home next day stack another two go home it will add up in the future you will realize how profitable you can be if you stop gambling and if you and you stop guessing taking trades that uh not really you are sure about so once the market push lower you have a first leg down pull back second leg down okay so i expect a bearish move i don't want to draw a downtrend like this because uh why because the uptrend is so strong
(27:17) this was a stronger uptrend much larger so this is just a correction so after two-legged move down market consolidated and you would expect price push above ema but it didn't happen there was additional move down so it this is already it was very confusing for me watching this live because what is this it is is this a downtrend you're pushing back above the ema but take a look how far away you're now from this uptrend the uptrend rule already played out you're not going to get new extreme after such a long correction your own long corrections are only for
(27:48) big patterns this is not a big pattern this is a medium uptrend this is not one one of those strong uptrends so you're not going to get a new extreme after such a pullback like this and you have a new low first century short pullback second entry short failure all right but like i said all i mentioned is really confusing here you're way too far down you're not sure you can be sure you can even look at this like this and what is valid this indecision you don't know what's valid and it's okay traders sometimes feel
(28:19) like on every single candle you have to know what's going on no it's completely okay to just sit some areas out it's completely normal the high priority setups take time to develop and you're going to have to sit here on your hands through some mess so get a felt second entry shoulder you don't want to take it and then you have a new high percentage long second and too long ema is holding boy oh boy i understand was this tempting but you have a ema completely flat in the middle's bars bunch of bars stacked overlapping no
(28:50) killer decision and this is why you have to respect the congestions because they suckered everybody in stop them out and this was a trap on all sides basically they traveled all the shorts all the longs this is why you want to avoid this stemi area stemming range this is a micro range but this is a friday quite late and i don't really recommend trying to trade this because this is just so messy if you compared with all the clean setups you had why would you try to battle and risk your uh capital on the battlefield like
(29:21) this and this is now already way too late so i'm rambling too long hopefully you guys find this useful and concise full i'm going to wrap it up hopefully guys hopefully you guys had a good trading day the ranges are really simple if you just draw the shortened trend lines you resist to urge to stick with these trends you have to fade them and you don't have to fade the breakouts if you're afraid just wait for the reversal pattern first central and second strong failure first century short second energy failure first century long second
(29:51) and first century long second strong failure and you can even get a few good second entry longs it can completely happen and you're expecting for price to eat the other side you can take a good second entry long so i'm gonna wrap it up and take care buddy



(270) 3 Simple Factors To Identify Market Direction - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) understanding the bias is one of the most important skills that traders need to master because without understanding when the market is going it is very hard for us to predetermine the places on the chart where high quality setup will appear and it is very hard for traders to identify the key entry point and when i'm trying to identify bias in the market i follow these three factors i take into consideration what the structure is i pay attention to ema and i followed the trendline rule now right from the very beginning the
(00:33) bias is very easy for us to identify because it is indecision this is a trading range prices are swinging up and up and down consistently this 21 bar exponential moving averages blue line is for the most part flat and once you see this you're playing the train range rules and at this point on there is no bias you're just following the shortened trend lines and paying attention to the market extremes inside this trading range now notice what happened next there is a bullish imbalance and market is reversing to the upside now according
(01:06) to train range rule most breakouts of touring ranges will fail but there is a point in price session when the new trend is so strong on its own that is already way too far above the initial trading range and you're not looking for prices to pull back you're paying attention to a new structure that is developing so what is the structure here by the time we're already up to here we're too far from the initial training range so structure is we keep pushing higher and weaker creating series of higher highs and higher lows
(01:37) ema is pointing up it's no longer flat it's pointing up and the last thing is i need to identify the trend line so i'm going to identify the trend line because market is always following some pattern candles are never alone on the chart without a pattern so at this point on you guys can see how nicely this channel is fitting and the bias is bullish now i know that the bias is bullish that means i'm looking for a high probably this setup at the key entry point to go long and the high priorities have to go long
(02:04) is a two legged pullback at the key entry point or felt to like a pullback felt second to short that goes against the trend so we have option working hard we have a first break for the uptrend bias is bullish and i expect after break to get new extreme according to training rule now i have to follow the shortened downtrend as well because the trend line rule applies even for the corrections and these corrections will filter a lot of losing trades because if you have this correction in play you don't want to go long only after you have a break
(02:34) and a new extreme form that is how you know that you're safe to look for lungs now when i was watching this unfortunately i had my trend lines a little bit tighter like this i didn't extend it on time so i had to break a new high but what i did wrong is i disregarded these first few swings notice the nice geomatical formation how the trend line is really setting up nicely and it's also holding nicely and off the highs as well so i misjudged it did a slightly and for that reason i didn't take the second and too long but if you're looking at the
(03:05) wider pattern which fits much better ema keeps holding prices and even though it is a little bit stacked because you got three four bars stacked you're still above ema decent bar and you expect to get new extremes so the bias is this is a second and too long at the key entry point you're not interested in chasing the market or taking first entries you can see what can happen if you take a first entry and even though market is working higher anytime it can reverse and backfire so you only want to wait for prices come to your key entry
(03:35) point that is where the high production will appear so now that we have a break new high we expect correction or straight up reversal but at this point on it can still look fairly bullish the structure is still bullish ema still keeps pointing up but the trend line will played out so something is different here market cannot keep thing higher like this because this is very steep notice how steep this uptrend is this is unnatural it needs to correct so this is so steep that i expect correction or possible reversal and notice what is happening
(04:05) ema is flattening and we're no longer creating series of higher highs and higher lows in fact we have lower highs and lower lows so it looks like we may eventually reverse now notice the setup we have here which is a little bit more advanced i'm going to mark because we have a new high first century long pullback second inch long a lot of traders are getting trapped taking a second into long but this second too long notice the difference it is not at the ema it's far from it which ema acts as a magnet that you will pull back and also upgram
(04:35) played out you have new high here you expect to get a new high so this is great trap is a little bit more advanced but as a felt second to long triple tap far away from ema you're probably going to pull back it's a little bit advanced but it's a great entry now i don't think i want to go short just yet because it's a little bit unclear here ema flattening is looking a little bit too sideways only after market is pushing below ema now you have to identify again what the bias is so the bush buys played out correction and notice ema is starting to
(05:08) point down series of lower high slow lows so i'm going to redraw my new pattern down and from this perspective bias is bearish and notice i have to draw the short term corrections we have a break of the uptrend new extreme formed telling you that it is okay to sell and you have a first century short pullback second entry short and you also have strong resistance here now this signal bar is not great so i will mark it it is a little bit aggressive in my liking also i had to break a new low small little break a new low
(05:47) for that reason i was really hesitant here what i like is that the triple top or the large double top is holding ema keeps holding the up jump laid out with the break in your height telling you that it's okay to sell had this signal bar been full bearish i would like it but with the bar being like this a little bit slow momentum but notice what is happening did the bias changed no the bias hasn't changed because ema keeps rejecting prices we keep creating lower highs and lower lows and i'm going to find a wider
(06:17) pattern because we had to break a new low but we keep creating new low so i'm going to find a wider pattern i need to keep drawing the shortened trend lines so once i'm watching this and this is only a first entry short so i cannot break the rule even though this worked this is just a first entry short so at this point on notice all of these three factors are working together and the bias is clearly bearish but notice what happened price is strongly pushed above ema and this is how you're using the ema notice how ema keeps holding here so
(06:47) this is telling you it is safe for you to go long and ema is rejecting price here this is telling you it is safe to go short as long as prices stay below ema you're thinking bearish and once prices push above ema something is changing the momentum is changing probably entire bias can change you don't know you're just more alerted that something is changing and this was caused by the news this is very unnatural but this completely shift the entire bias because this option played out with the breaking new high we're not creating a strong downtrend
(07:20) and we're strongly pushing above ema so that means if i'm going to zoom out like this and take into consideration this entire structure doesn't this look too bullish it does so i'm going to use these first two swings right here i'm going to connect these three swings just gonna copy it put it at the top and this makes sense from this perspective the overall bias in the market has been established and everything has changed at this point on i'm mostly looking for longs throughout this entire area the bigger pattern was just under development and i
(07:55) can pay attention to the shortened patterns and even to this downtrend after this bounce and strong push above ema everything changed and the bias right now the main bias for the day is bullish structure you keep creating overall higher highs are lows the trend line is in play and ema is not going to be such a factor because it is such a wide pattern so you can keep going sideways or potentially slightly lower because there may be corrections because the big pattern is so big that the ema can change but still
(08:25) the ema for the most part is trending higher and notice how the key entry point is coming nicely into place so every time someone tells you the market geometry isn't a real thing they just don't know how to draw the trend lines because it is a skill that can be mastered but it is a skill and it takes time to learn so as prices are pushing higher above ema this is where i have to redraw the uptrend and notice what we have a massive overshoot and this is caused by the news and you can tell that this is unnatural activity
(08:53) overshoot can lead to a break of a channel or possibly straight up reversal so once i see overshoot like this i'm going to measure it and this is my first target where i expect prices to go you guys can see perfect measured overshoot so you can expect break or possibly straight up reversal do we expect reversal after this overshoot not necessarily because main pattern is very bullish so we're most likely just going to break and get a new low can i take a second and too long i cannot after overshoot i need to wait for a
(09:25) high low but even then ema is flattening we're going sideways and this downtrend is in play it worked here but next time i'm gonna go long here it will trap me and it may fail and you guys can see it was not too long before price created a new extreme that was needed and only here now you're getting the idea that it is okay for you to start buying again because new low was established in the market now after new low form notice price strongly pushed above the support and gave you new high first century long second inch long now
(10:01) this is not a bad entry it is a little bit advanced i saw a couple traders took it i'm going to mark it it is very advanced because you need to know what you're doing you need to pay attention that the downtrend played out with the new low you need to take into consideration the entire bias but it is a nice high low second and too long excuse me support keeps holding when i was watching this live i wanted to take a felt second entry short i wanted for prices to trigger below this second entry short trap everybody going short and reversed
(10:32) but there was no trigger here so this is just bullish bar without actual trigger without actual field second entry short so unfortunately you just have to sit here and watch it and by the time you get a little bit higher you're way too close to this resistance and you have first century long second inch long there's a two legged pullback which is a high quality setup if you combine it with the key entry point and the overall bias but it is way too close to this resistance and you can see what can happen you can get barely out before
(10:59) market reversing down okay so even though this is like a pullback you have to be patient so even though the clear bias today is bullish it was quite hard for us to get a setup because they just didn't form that well for us to take them so what is the shortened bias shortened bias is trading range just like here the train range is forming because ema is flat there are no higher highs or low highs or anything like that it's just sideways so shortened biases training range but for the most part the main pad and the main bias is still bullish there
(11:32) is pretty much nothing else to be changing the bias is bullish notice what we had prices came back tested and confirmed the key entry point to the t and also prices broke below this consolidation this is a training range this right here acts the same way as right here this is just a smaller form of a trading range so the train range rule apply as well most breakouts of ranges will fail if the breakout breaks to the upside are we going to fade it and sell it we're not because the main pattern is bullish but if it breaks to the downside and we
(12:07) fade it i'm fading it with the entire direction of the trend so this is a decent entry to take once again a little bit more advanced because this is not a textbook too like a pullback i wanted to see a second inch long when i was watching this live or possibly some push above ema i was a little bit too careful and hesitant here i was supposed to pull the trigger because not because it is a confirmation of the trend line but if you combine it with the field breakout out of the trading range this makes sense but you'll be taking a
(12:37) risk here this is not one of those clean high priority setups like you're taking a two legged pullback at the key entry point uh you're definitely taking a risk here but from the price action perspective this is a decent entry now market kept pushing higher and by the time you get high or low you're too far up and you don't get even close to get the good felt second entry short now you have a small break new high and market is reversing and notice i want to bring your attention to how market is working markets can never go straight up or
(13:07) never go straight down market need to have pullbacks in between and you need to make sure you're buying at these lows you're buying the pullback face or once it bouncing to the upside you cannot be buying the exhaustion phase because you can see what can happen if you buy a second inch along here second entry along here or second inch along here it's too late by that point a lot of times traders can get trapped taking a late second inch long in the exhaustion phase but you're really supposed to be buying in the pullback face as close to
(13:41) the key entry point as you can fortunately there is no good second to long here so you don't get trapped but once you see breaking new high and it feels like the market is losing steam you're probably going to reverse and pull back down so what is the bias here still bullish shortened bias is bearish but it's so short term i'm not even thinking about selling overall main buys in this market is still bullish we keep creating higher highs our lows we get the trendline rule still in play and the ema for the most part is pushing
(14:15) up and holding prices now i was about to go along on a felt second entry short because notice how key entry point keeps holding again but notice the congestion 10 bar stacked next to each other a lot of stems i just cannot force almost went along here but i cannot just force here and break the rules by the time you push above ema you're too far from the exponential moving average because you have a new low first century short pullback second entry short once again not a bad entry at all the bias is in your favor everything is in
(14:49) your favor but you're not touching the ema so not a bad entry but i really would prefer prices to touch the ema the market was very slow at this point in hindsight looks good if there was momentum maybe but when you're watching this live the market is slowly but surely crawling up and you really need a convincing entry today market was extremely slow so there was no convincing engine notice you have a break two legs to the next stream and you get new high first century long second inch long and at this point on
(15:18) it's too late for you to go long up champ laid out and notice how each the bullish move up is getting smaller and smaller and you can see that the market is about to tilt you're going into a wedge where the resistance keeps holding the trend line keeps holding as well and this is too congested this is too messy and you got to be careful not going long once you get into this wedge the trend is losing steam once you see so much empty room at the top portion of the trend channel this is telling you that the market keeps reversing notice
(15:54) how these pushes to the upside are smaller smaller and smaller this is telling you that the market will eventually break the main trend line so the bias throughout this entire market is still bullish but notice what is happening we're breaking the channel and right now we are changing the bias we are no longer creating higher highs and higher lows but we broke the trend line we're below ema and we keep creating lower highs and lower lows so shortened bias is getting bearish and i need to respect it when i was watching this i expected to get
(16:28) pushed above ema into a reversal pattern that never form and when you're watching price action remember bigger patterns may get longer corrections when you have a gigantic pattern like this you don't want to be going along too quickly because there needs to be a longer correction that's just how it works in price action so once you had to break a new low and we didn't push above ema ema kept rejecting price and we pushed below i reassessed the bias took into consideration these three factors and what is the bias lower high
(16:59) slow lows ema keeps rejecting prices and at this point on i need to extend the downtrend because this is way too short when you look at the price action this is way too tight and the correction is probably going to be a little bit bigger also what has helped you to understand the market because this first leg up second leg up and it didn't push above ema it continued pushing lower so this is telling you there's probably more basic momentum and the shortened bias is bearish and we have second entry short lower high confirming the second entry
(17:28) short decent high probability setup it was a little bit too stacked but confirming second entry short great bearish bar take the highest reverse down ema kept holding you probably need to create new extreme new extreme was formed and prices pushed above ema so once prices are pushing back above the ema and now we're creating higher highs and higher lows we're above ema no longer below so that means that i expect to get new high for the main pattern the overall bias the bigger bias is resuming and if we stay above ema even the
(18:00) shortened bias is going to be bullish so i was watching for felt second entry short same thing i was watching here i'm watching here new low first century short pullback second entry short i'm looking for a second entry short to fail and it indeed felt ema kept holding trendline kept holding i took this entry from 2500 tick chart because the signal bar here is really bad it looked much better there so there is not really a great entry here but i took this entry my only trade for the day on a 2500 tick chart both the
(18:31) entry points holding price you expect to get new high bias is changing and then you had new high form first century long second inch long two like a pullback two legs down ema keeps holding prices i'm going to mark this entry it is not a bad entry it's just a little bit closer to these highs but once the signal bar is so full bullish it's definitely worth the chance and you guys can see we're getting very close to the close once your short run trendline has a break in your extreme pay attention to how ema is reacting
(19:04) that's how you will recognize that there may be a more potential in depend because just like here the shortened trend has the break and you low notice there's a two like a pullback and it's formed below ema same thing right here shorthand trend had to break a new low but two like a pullback below ema again so that tells you that there's probably a slightly wider pattern and you can take additional lower high but always try to focus on the bigger pattern once this confirmation confirm the trend line stick with the bullish
(19:36) pattern and the bigger patterns may take time to correct but what you expect still eventually to push above ema and for prices to create new extreme eventually

Transcript:
(00:00) all right Traders we're going to talk about price session trading how to navigate the price charts and how to understand price session rules There are rules and price session that the candlesticks are following there's a reason to price movement and it takes time to learn to read the chart but there are price session rules that can help us to identify direction of the market and what is the high probability setup now we're looking at two examples of high priority setups in front of us and this is a variation of a two-legged
(00:27) pullback because Market doesn't move in these straight reshape formations there are correction within the moves and this sounds simple but if you train your eyes to see it this is exactly the way how Market likes to move and there are two legged pullbacks within the price movement and if you combine the two-legger pullback with the proper Market context and a key entry point a high product setup may appear so you have two high priority setups on the left we have a two-legged pullback second and too long off the trend line
(00:57) and the support which is a key entry point and we have second entry short of the trend line and off the resistance now on the right we have a fell to like a pullback that means that this is a two-legger pullback that is forming under the wrong context and we are interested in this setup as well because if you're reading the context correctly and you can see to like a pullback on the wrong side of the market you can take advantage of the Trap traders who are on the wrong side of the context in this video we're going to go through how
(01:26) to identify these high product setups using price action rules and we're going to go through basics of the price session so it is going to be a little bit more big and friendly now when I'm first watching the chart I need to identify what exactly is the pattern and this would be the structure that I would be looking at and we can see that the structure if I'm just relying on the naked candlesticks without any indicator although I'm using one indicator this 21 bar exposure moving average this blue line this is
(01:53) just a supportive indicator helping me to identify the bias a bit better and helping me to identify how far prices are away from EMA because prices tend to pull back to Ema regularly so what I can see I have Spike up I have very strand down and I have positioned up so this is not a healthy Trend in either direction this is a train range structure up and down up and down so what I have to do I need to identify key levels for the train range I have the support here which I always want to identify the law of the day
(02:23) during the pre-market support and the high of the day resistance at the top so I have extremes for the string range and now that I'm looking at the structure which Market is opening somewhere around this area I'm going to zoom in a little bit more I can see that the structure is no longer pointing to the bullish Direction but instead it's flattening notice EMA is getting flatter it's no longer pointing up and I can see move up move down move up and the move down is starting to happen so now I'm getting signs the
(02:54) inside of this bigger train range there may be a smaller train range as well and for that reason I need to identify the smaller training range so what I'm going to do I'm going to look for confirmations of these lows and you can see I have some bounds here bounce here and bounce here which looks pretty legit you don't have to be perfect you just have to be close and with time you will get the sense where the lines may be appropriately the important thing is to realize that you are in a train range so you don't get caught selling too low or
(03:24) buying too high and notice on the chart you can see a lot of lines I have drawn and this is because I want to follow the trendline rule I want to stay on the right side of the market because if I don't follow the trendline rule correctly if I don't draw these trend lines I can get trapped on wrong to like a pullback and Traders can take advantage of me being on the wrong side of the market and that's what I don't want to do I want to stay on the right of the market and take advantage of the other Traders so we started with the very Spike down
(03:50) we have a channel working lower notice we have a break of this channel right here a market created new extreme indicating depletion of the British downtrend and bearish momentum is over and if you push above the support and above EMA this is indication that the support this potential train range is coming into play and the buyers are starting to buy so you're combining two price action rules yield the trendline rule and the train range Rule now however from the very top all the way down we can see prices keeps rejecting
(04:21) quite consistently and for that reason even though I have a breaking low I'm not interested in buying because you never know how many pushes lower you're going to make if you see so many rejections of the EMA it is a small move yes but it is still showing signs of rejection I don't really want to pick bottom even though according to train range rules most breakouts will fail the safest way to play this is to wait for push above EMA and to get a felt second entry short high protection we have a new overall secondary show right here but the signal
(04:51) bar is not great it is a bearish bar I want to buy about bullish bar so this is more advanced and more aggressive I won't like taking this because of the signal bar but I had the signal bar been much bullish just moving great entry and let's talk about why this is a failed second entry shot because this is the lowest point in this move down so this is where I start counting and the first entry short will trigger after break below the low of either one of these bars because we have series of three bars working higher
(05:19) and we finally broke below this bar low triggering the first entry short so we have first entry shot here which failed correction working higher and I'm looking for the same thing I'm looking for break below These Bars lows and the first bar we broke Below in the second leg is right here so we go first leg first entry short second leg second entry short triggering below this bar right here notice the low of this bullish bar we take one take lower triggering second entry short and a failed secondary short so everybody's
(05:54) going short on the two like a pullback but the context is wrong that's what this makes a good felt second entry because context is not good downtrend play that with the break new low indicating sellers are over and the support of the train range is holding so expect buyers to come into the market so in fact you're taking advantage of the Trap sellers it's close to Ema it's a great reversal pattern but the single bar from really bad and notice prices are doing the same thing just to the opposite side because we have shortened up Trends with
(06:24) the break new extreme you have pushable EMA but notice this felt second too long I cannot take this field second inch long new high first center Long pull back second entry long failure because it is too far from EMA and the single bar is doji even though it worked here next time you take it so far from EMA you will get burned you'll be wondering why this quote-unquote hyper this should have failed but this is not high proud to setup because it is really far away from EMA you cannot gamble like this you really want to see
(06:49) it close to Ema like this but you can see how EMA is flat a lot of price Rings up and down and you are in the train range so this is the structure you're focusing on You're Expecting for most breakouts to fail because that's according to price session train range rules prices will pull back into train range 90 of the time you can see down to working lower file by break new extreme again indicating downtrend played out support is holding in this blue rectangle is indicating a news event which you can see is Spike in volatility you don't be
(07:17) trading during this part of the spike now when I was watching this at this point I was a little bit more bullish I was expecting Halo off to like a pullback because I hit my resistance a little bit higher like this and generally when you see smaller train range smaller resistance so close to the main one prices will come all the way up and they will test the main resistance now it was a little bit Tad lower so prices day tested but you really want to see more significant push however prices are pushing or we get a felt second in
(07:45) too long but it is above EMA and at this point you can see area on a chart without any decent high quality setup I cannot really sell any setup here I cannot buy any setup here so this is just quite confusing it's getting a little bit stacked no clear Bice is looking too bullish but at the same time prices are struggling to save off EMA so this is just the area where you sit on the chart because no price session rules are allowing me to take entry in either direction so I'm just saying patiently notice prices are pulling back into the
(08:15) strain range we have a strong downshore working lower we have a break two legs to a new extreme and notice are we expecting here for prices to push back into the train range we are not and why not well here's a little bit of a Nuance because when I was watching this and I saw prices forming this first century short I Was preparing to draw my trend line a little bit wider like this now why am I doing this if I'm saying that most breakout strains will fail and you're expecting for prices to push back into training
(08:45) Trail first of all some breakout will eventually work the way how can I identify that I expect for bearish bias to continue is notice from the very full breakout at the top from the very resistance all the way down to the support and even push below support prices haven't touched EMA once they never close above EMA they never confirmed it we never got bounds of the EMA so there is like a hockey stick swoosh lower from the verified breakout all the way down here which is indicating to me that we may have a follow-through of the best
(09:16) momentum okay because if you take a look at structure inside the string range you can see EMA is still being touched multiple times and the moves are quite weak this was quite a significant move from the felt breakout all the way down here so this is how you're using a bit more of a Advanced chart reading skill to help you identify what's going on you can really see how prices are not touching the EMA for a long time first two strings will help you identify the channel in the trend line and now you get a confirmation and notice here we have a
(09:42) high product setup we have a new low first attempt to sell because price is broke below this bar right here you can see we have one two three four four bullish bars one bearish bar triggering first entry short it felt instantly because there is not a high quality setup the high product setup is a two-legged pullback that will indicate the end of the correction and we have second entry short triggering here decent bearish bar fortunately I didn't have doji I had one tick buried body which is a good indication that I can at least try to
(10:13) take it up jump later with the breaking new extreme the shortened correction has a breaking High which is indicating that bullish went on played out I need to draw the shortened channels even for the corrections not only for the main channels because those Corrections need to get new Extreme as well okay so break new high indicating this option played out and I have multiple key entry points this channel the EMA is a key entry point as well and notice the support I identified earlier is now acting as the resistance price is broke
(10:44) came back tested the breakout area and I have three key entry points second entry short high quality setup and this is the tool like a pullback like this but on the right context okay it's all about identifying the context properly so this is my first trade for the day Market continue pushing lower and there is a long time without a good setup why well because notice all these channels are in play and they don't have new extremes plus you know there is really no great entry of a second entry short here actually new low first entry shot
(11:15) here pullback second entry Shore but you know short and option is in play it's above EMA and it's waiting for prices to push below EMA then I have new low I have first entry shot here only I don't have two legged pullback nothing just no good high quality above EMA you know no good setup I can see that prices created move to a new extreme pull back second move to New stream and there was a tiny little lag to new extreme when I was watching this and this looked quite bearish I was leaning more towards prices reaching the new low
(11:44) so I was looking for potential by the channel like this but notice what we have here we have new low first entry short second entry short failure and we almost had double trap body to form above EMA and it was doji bar but I would not take this anyway because if I'm going to draw this we're failing to reach the bottom of the trenchant line the trend is losing Steam and it just feels like the correction needs to be a little bit stronger okay so you need to have more confirmation you can see eventually once prices are pushing
(12:12) higher you're going to adapt and I'm just going to delete the wider Channel and stick to this shortened Channel working to the upside so as the prices are working higher I need to respect the shortened uptrend the downtrend laid out so I'm forgetting about the beige downtrend I'm just looking for high products helps to go long so once I have a break here of this uptrend I expect New Height to be formed so what am I looking for is second inch long to like a pullback preferably closing near the EMA I would want to see first leg down pull back
(12:43) second leg down here but that never fall market just created move up and we had a new high form which indicated the bullish option played out okay this is the highest high which I can reset the count and we have a first entry long because we broke Above This bullish bar indicating first inches long pull back second inch long now why am i counting for a second and too long if the uptrend played out well because if the option played out I expect reversal now I no longer can look for Longs because this option title you can identify this
(13:16) channel easily there's no denying how nicely prices are fitting needle inside this channel so we have a break new high indicating trendline will play it out I'm in overall train range so I don't have to be worried about any other pattern pretty much I only have to follow the shortened price action you can see the reason to help prices move that is very reliable to our process move it's of course it's much harder to do it real time and you have a little bit more conflicting patterns and setups may go fast you may not catch the setup
(13:42) but these are the price action rules that with the experience with Tom you're able to see it more and more with better reliability and you're able to build the confidence in the chart reading skill because we have a new high first entry long second entry long failure and this was my second trade for the day that I took the setup worked for for more than eight ticks I actually use Eliminator 2 ticks back so I was out really quickly because this was extremely fast trade but you can see that you can actually approach it even a little bit
(14:13) differently because I marked this setup right here which if you're an advanced Trader and you understand the price session you can kind of look at these highs and see that this is one area of matching highs and you can reset the count here so you have new high first entry along here a pullback second inch long failure so a couple Traders looked at it that way it's closer to Ema this downtrend still needs to get new extreme so nothing wrong with tuning this like this I counted from this very high as a first entry long second engine long
(14:42) failure there is no problem if you're more advanced and confident in the price session that you can actually reset the count and take even this setup right here and notice price is created two legs down one more push down and Mark It reversed strongly Five Points in the bullish bars above EMA this is why using the EMA as well to show you how there is no rejection strong momentum and by the way just like I did here I see email putting up flattening and I could see up down up down I see training structure I'm starting to see the same
(15:14) thing right here I have EMA pointing up flattening and I have up and down up and down training structure so I need to identify the key levels so when I was watching this this is what I was looking for something like this and notice this bullish option has a break new high so both bullish Trends have new extreme for the reason even though I have a new high here and I have a first century long pull back second inch long I have to like a pullback I cannot take this long because both uptrends played out now when I'm going
(15:45) to look at the structure I can see that prices failed to reach the support so there is a little bit of a bullish imbalance a little bit of a bush momentum however I cannot still go long but notice if you're a seller and you're playing The Strain range and you're looking for felt second and too long which is not a bad idea to be looking for you have new high for essential long here pull back second inch long here failure but the felt second entry long form on the wrong side of the EMA if you're a seller you want
(16:12) to sell it's Felts against your loan below EMA because you want to see confirmation of the best momentum price is pushing below the EMA this is how useful the exponential Moon average is the fact that it didn't happen and it felt second entry long form above expunge moving average is now indicating to you that this high low trapped all the early Setters and if you combine it with the fact that you have two legs down dungeon has a break new low this high low is a confirmation of this second inch long great high quality
(16:41) setup you trap all the early Setters selling peltic entry along this setup was however very fast because you're not quite predicting a high low because you can get felt second inch long but once it Formed above EMA at the last second a nice Hollow form indicating all the early cells get trapped nice high low confirmation the second too long and marking continue working higher okay so you can see the training structure keeps developing with a bullish bias so this is pretty much area where there is no high quality setup there is not a
(17:12) single second entry line or second entry short notice flat EMA a lot of indecision you are at the top of the train range but you have no good setup to sell you have no good self to buy there's a possible Channel like this which I'm looking for because after you push above EMA you have to gauge the structure if this is a train range notice how much empty room there's at the bottom and you have another strong push above EMA so this is concerning this is basically negating the train range however I can still see
(17:44) some resistance I'm just gonna move it higher because I don't want to go long directly into these highs we can get burned fairly easily even though this option is in play now you can see still there is no setup notice how many bars are overlapping this is a congestion you want to see clean structure here here you'll see clean pattern clean hype about the setup this is area of indecision you're too close to resistance but you're too far up in a bullish momentum to sell so that's pretty much no setup here at all
(18:12) you get a high low here but it's way too big too far up and notice Mark is pushing higher okay so this channel has multiple new extremes so I definitely cannot tell if I'm going to zoom back really Zoom back and take a look at the entire structure notice the clear bullish bias that is present in this market and in fact there is even a wider spike in a channel which I'm not going to draw just yet but this is a possibility at this time but you can definitely identify later on but notice so many high highs so many high lows and
(18:43) the train range is very large on its own okay there are big trends strong Trends inside the string range the reason why I'm talking about this because Trader took this felt second entry long and he was wondering why it failed but this is too early when the train range is big and there are Trends strong on their own you want to see proven Trend in the opposite direction you cannot take this felt second entry along reversal pattern because it is just too early to pick a tab there's so much of a bushment to him there's bullish bias so
(19:11) this is early short so you don't want to sell your thinking bullish but you really need to be selective you have a new high for essential long second entry long below EMA micro double bottom resets the count if I see micro double bottom and if you push above EMA and I get higher low there is going to be a confirmation setup and indeed that's what happened dungeon has a break attempt to create new low strong push above Yemen you have higher low but notice by the time it Formed it got quite congested you know this is not a
(19:40) horrible setup if it wasn't so congestive would have been a great setup but EMA is flat it's a little bit stacked but you can see emac is holding prices and from this very low now we have first attempt to sell pull back second attempt to sell and another sellers selling second entry short under the wrong context because we have series of high highs and high lows so the structure is way too bullish to sell directly into EMA while EMA is holding and after this big bullish bar formed this basically changed the bias quickly it wasn't
(20:10) looking like that it looked like prices May create second leg down for this first leg but at the last second this big bullish bar form which is indicating to you that they all got trapped and you want to take advantage of these Traders which is a felt second entry short of the EMA a nice big bullish bar and this was a quick easy High product setup now you can see you're bouncing off the main kill of the day Market is correcting break new low got like a first leg down second leg down I mark this high low as an
(20:40) aggressive setup because you have breaking low here you have definitely break here you have two visual legs you have strong push above EMA so aggressive Trader can't take a chance here on a hollow because trading is about taking a chance it's about probabilities so this is not a horrible setup but you want to see a felt second entry short to get a trap just like here to be sure but if you took it there's a case for this to be made however I would really prefer to see a felt secondary short to be more sure because at this
(21:09) point on you're bouncing off the resistance you may have correction Market is correcting lower you have second entry short but there are so many higher highs this main channel that we're going to talk about soon is in play even if you don't have it in play you just don't want to reverse the market too if you want to see a proven momentum there is a break new low for this by the downtrend and notice prices strongly pushed above EMA okay so once you now showing a push above EMA and there is no longer bearish follow
(21:34) through this dungeon has a break new extreme and this is all the momentum sellers have generated and follow with such a big push above EMA this is confirming the bullish bias again so this is definitely a confirmation and I know a lot of Traders play this oops play this nice bike on the channel very early but I'm hesitant to draw really wide patterns too quickly because they really don't come into play too often and this is one of the few wide patterns that were actually valid note that this is a very wide channel in train range so you can
(22:04) see even in train ranges occasionally you will have a white pattern so this white pattern was confirmed definitely after you have strong push above EMA and now you can see breaking low so the downtrend played out strong push above EMA and you have new high first century long pull back second entry long first leg down pull back second leg down and down jump play that with the breaking low so this right here is the high protein setup just like here the tool I get pulled back setup okay the context is bullish you can see
(22:37) you're on the right side of the EMA the two like a pullback and you can see this is how Market likes to move and it's just about training your eyes to see it you can see another first leg second leg so there are these two like a pullbacks which if you don't know what to look for can be quite hard to make sense of this because if you're going to zoom back you see a lot of price movements especially if you don't know where are the key levels where are the key entry points can be a little bit hard to make sense
(23:02) of this but this is why there are these price action rules this is why we study the chart every day and you need to study your chart every day after your training session that's the only way you're gonna learn it if you don't start your chart and you don't work on the skill it will be pretty hard for you to make a significant progress you need to be in the game immersed in trading every single day in that way you keep practicing you keep progressing so it's really important to go back and study your trades after the fact and learn
(23:30) from your mistakes and even learn from the winners because sometimes you can take a winning trade and you can just get lucky that can happen you know on every single candle there's a 50 chance that it's gonna go in your direction even if you're reading the context wrong so even you have to study your winners so you make sure you're not just getting lucky and you're just not gambling you really want to make sure you're building a foundation of following the rules properly and not just gambling so you have to like a pullback here when I was
(23:55) watching this I would not probably take this doji-ish bar I knew a lot of Traders had nice bullish bar here with a little bit of bush body which is a great setup there's nothing wrong with waiting for this bullish bar to finish and drop your limit order because this right here now confirmed this bar this is kind of like tool reversal bar entry so you can definitely wait for this bar to finish because EMA is now holding it even the support here is a little bit showing you can see small support previously act as a resistance and this
(24:22) main Channel needs to get new extreme which now a new extreme was formed and you can see Market is pulling back because most breakouts of training just will fail and this main option has new extreme so you definitely want to be careful so I hope the video was helpful educational I'm gonna see you guys in the next one take care everybody





(270) Master The Technical Aspect Of Pure Price Action - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viVjkkB0TuE

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video we're going to talk about nature of price action how to identify the direction of the market and what are the technical aspects of channels today we got to trade a very strong very solo but Market didn't provide us with a lot of easy high probability setups as you would normally have and for that reason this allow us to dive deeper into the technical aspects of the direction of the market and channels now as you can see today's session started with bearish structure you can see that I have this blue line on the
(00:31) chart this is 21 bar expansion moving average this is a supportive indicator only mainly we are relying on reading the pure price action as these candlesticks are printing on the chart so we can see that we have series of lower highs low lows but we need to understand that in price action every single movement is part of some pattern so Trader's goal is to identify a channel to make sure we get the market Direction down right and we know where the prices may turn and generally how we're going to identify the channel
(01:02) properly is we're going to look at the very start of the move and try to connect first couple of swings first two swings we'll set the trend line and third swing generally confirms the channel so this right here is the swing that the day session started with and this is the second major swing that produce a very strong and sharp solo so if I'm just going to play around with it and look for a channel connecting these first few swings you can see how nicely I can find channel here I'm getting a third swing confirmation so I'm just
(01:31) going to copy it put it at the bottom and this is nicely fitting downtrend now the nature of a channel like this and it's important to understand is that every single channel has push face and Correctional phase push face is the move down in very downtrend correction phase follows correction phase generally ends at the top of the key entry point where all the smart Traders are selling and the push face is starting again and notice once you reach the trend chain line the push face may end and the correction phase
(02:04) May start as well and once again correction phase May end at the top of the channel this is why Traders are trying to locate the proper Channel and you can see it's not random at all there's a clear distant reason to price movement and it is easily identifiable of course it takes skill sometimes it's not that easy to find a proper Channel but important thing is that there is always some form of a pattern that the prices are following the reason why are we talking about the push face and correction phase is because once you see
(02:34) prices reaching the trend chain line you expect a Little Bit Stronger correction okay that doesn't mean that you're looking for Longs you're still looking for shorts if you get a good short setup and the downturn is strong you still want to sell but you cannot be as blind towards the bush momentum while you're reaching the trenchant line and the correction phase is starting for that reason notice push face ended small little correction push way started push face ended smooth correction and the correction phase is ending here and the
(03:07) push face is starting for that reason you don't be forcing any setups here they are sketchy doji signal bars you're in the middle of this congestion this is a train range you don't be trading these tight areas you want to fade a breakout but you can see we never really get a breaker we have a stronger push to the upside another rule that trend lines are following is the trendline rule which sets after break of a channel we expect new extreme to be formed and here we have two conflicting patterns we have this uptrend that has a break and needs
(03:38) to get new extreme and we have this downtrend that has a break and needs to get new Extreme as well and by the way notice in this Birch channel the high probability setups are second attempts to sell so you have second entry short here not only at the trend line but also at the resistance triple test and we have felt second entry loan because second entry long is going to be considered trap if the structure is very downtrend so the breakout pullback pattern of this smaller train range the support is acting as resistant alongside
(04:07) with the EMA so what we're going to do about this pattern right here as I'm watching this downtrend the only thing I'm keeping in back of my mind is for the most part expecting felt second engine long we may get new extreme for this uptrend we may not that's particularly not my worry that's not my problem if you get new high great I'm still looking for felt second entry along if you don't get a new high and we'll blow EMA I'm still expecting for second engine on why because the bigger pattern and price action takes
(04:35) precedence notice how tiny this correction is even though these seven bullish consecutive bars it's meaningless compared to this big overall dungeon working rollover so going to rules and price session on a balance of probabilities the bigger channel will overpower the smaller one and we have new high for essentially long pull back second inch long failure so we have a default second actually longer we expected but notice how it form or my chart I can see that it formed as a doji didn't really push below EMA EMA getting a little bit flat
(05:06) not the cleanest setup this is a shame because context is perfect and especially at the start of the day where you have no ambiguity about the channel these setups are so reliable I'm going to mark it even with red not because it is a great setup to take the weighted form because the context is good and you want to study this trade that because the next time you get a great signal bar you definitely want to take this setup so make sure to study this I didn't take it because it formed a little bit sketchy I would mark it as aggressive setup but
(05:37) it's a great help to study because these ones are very reliable as you see them print on the chart now we have new extreme formed but you can see another push down and a very strong sell-off again and this was caused by the new this is news announcement very strong sell-off and this leads me to believe that the bearish bias is a little bit stronger than expected because after you have a new low you have another push to a new low and a such a very strong push to a new extreme that means that the structure is still bearish downtrend and
(06:09) is strong so for that reason I'm going to delete this Channel and just see if I can find slightly wider pattern if I'm going to connect these first few swings I'm just going to extend it to here you can see it still fits perfectly so my channel is really not distorted at all this is still a very reasonable channel it's just a little bit wider which is okay because I'm getting more information from the market that right now this is a very strong base off and you can go on a 10 000 tick chart to higher time frame
(06:35) to confirm your initial analysis now here we have overshoot now what overshoot leads to and what overshoot means overshoot is a natural activity in the market and this indicates oversold territory you don't need no Voyager bands or RSI you can really just see this based on pure price action because take a look decent sell-off decent correction decent sell-off decent correction decent sell-off and suddenly unnatural sell-off 90 degree Spike News Cost event and very unnatural for that reason this is overshoot an overshoot can lead to a
(07:13) break of a Channel or passively straight up reversal which means we can expect a Little Bit Stronger Bush momentum now I even looked at it as a wider Channel overall because we can get a little bit stronger bear dungeon which we eventually did either way I'm still focusing on the aspect of the push face and correction phase we still had very strong and overextended push phase so we can have stronger Bush momentum in the opposite side but we can see that we have no confirmation of this channel prior but if I'm going to draw it a little bit
(07:45) higher I can see that this makes sense because I have more confirmations here channel is a little bit tighter and this acts more as an overshoot for that reason you can see how prices are suddenly correcting more and EMA is holding a little bit more you can even see sideways EMA smaller train range and this is important to take into consideration now I can also even it's very common measure the overshoot and see if I get measure break on the other side and you can see you almost get measured break before prices will
(08:15) eventually reverse now as we are watching this overshoot I also want to talk about these lower highs now we didn't really get triggerable of this bar right here so there's technically no lower high but I want to talk about the technical aspects of low high during a structure like this generally when we are unsure if the bearish bias is clean if the bullish correction is weak and insignificant we want to see trap we want to see felt secondary long so as I'm watching all these little highs I don't want to take them because I don't know how strong the
(08:50) overshoot will be I don't know how many pushes higher it's going to make how do I know that it's going to end here and not to make this initial push-up there's no way for me to know sometimes overshoot can keep pushing higher for the reason the only segue for me to know that market and it is Bush momentum and the Burj dungeon is resuming is if I get bullish trap a second and too long below EMA feltic angelona in this instance we unfortunately never got it we just have a very strong sell-off by 80 of the time you will almost always
(09:20) get a nice photo second inch long just like you did here for Central and second control failure for Central and second draw failure but this time we didn't get it so for that reason when you're taking lower highs just keep in mind that you want to make sure that the structure is easy to understand the bullish correction is weak minimal here we've been working to the upside basically for hour notice we are working hard we are working high so this lower high is way too late after bullish structure so low Highs are generally after second
(09:51) entries if it's a clear train range without imbalance lower Highs are great if it's a strong downtrend without significant bullish push you can take lower high but not like this when you can see the stronger Bush momentum this one I want to see a nice felt second entry long forming close to Ema and it is the last bullish trap I want to talk about is the strength of a downtrend and this option because you may be tempted to draw wider pattern like this and is this the proper way to approach it well as you may already feel it is not
(10:24) we have very few confirmations it is too wide and too flat this would be a channel that we would use if the uptrend was the pattern for the day from the very beginning but we traded down into the structure the downtrend is much stronger you can combine it with a high time frame to see it and doesn't take charge that the down to destroy the main pattern and this is basically just visual first leg here pull back kind of like a second like first leg pull back second like you can see it on higher time frames for the reason
(10:55) this is very weak angle the option is too flat I'm sticking to these channels and I'm just waiting for prices to end this overshoot we're most likely not going to get reversal because the downtrend was strong we're just going to break the channel as you can see unfortunately you have to sit here a long time without taking a high probability setup now there are a couple of Longs here that you may argue this second entry long or even this one me personally the way I trade I always follow the main bias since the main bias
(11:27) is bearish I don't want to over complicate my trading and I want to always stick to the main pattern the main buy side I'm always looking to sell but a more advanced Trader or if you just have different personality you can make a case for a couple of these quick scalps to the upside because you can recognize the shorter momentum that's absolutely okay I'm just pointing out that me personally I don't like over complicating anything there's already enough variables to keep in mind in trading so when I see bearish buys like
(11:55) this basically I'm just letting the bullish correction play out and I'm just waiting for a good high probability setup to sell but it's just me personal how I like to approach the market you may Wonder here we have felt second engine along here yes but it is in the middle of this train range you don't know if the bullish correction truly played out just nothing is clean here you know no good cell setup at this point on felt breakout very tempting because you have a static resistance it looks like the last push-up it even
(12:22) looks like a first like second legs but all these setups are a little bit more advanced and more selective but finally you can see a very strong sell-off at first I'm drawing Channel type like this but you can see consistent rejections I'm going to adapt to wider Channel because we have a very strong downtrend overall now notice here we reached new low for this downtrend this low has been exceeded by one or two ticks right here so that means we expect correction or reversal or the downtrend can continue if it was
(12:55) strong to begin with which it was we have new low first century short secondary short according to price action rules if we get new extreme taking a second entry is risky you may get reverse a pattern you may get trapped we don't want to take second entry the setup that I weight if I see EMA rejecting and I don't see reverse structure and the downturn was strong I'll need to see confirmation of the second entry short lower high or in this instance we get a feltic entry along which can be basically treated the
(13:23) same way so in order to have null first entry shot second entry short which we don't want to take anyway because notice it's not fully at the EMA so you have new extreme it's not full at the EMA we're not interested however shortly after you get new high for essential on pull back second entry long failure that's the confirmation of the best momentum of the second entry short and even this smaller downtrend needs to get new extreme so this right here is a great high priority setup great single bar I was a little bit greedy I had my
(13:49) limit order a little bit up and for that reason I missed this setup and probably the only easy setup for the day so you can see Market continue working lower I was expecting some train range like this I was not expecting to get continuation of the basement because now even this channel has a break new low so all channels on my chart just to reach new extreme and you don't want to be too greedy too overconfident that the doctor is just going to go forever so I was expecting a little bit stronger correction but notice the train
(14:22) range was absolutely negated it didn't hold it all you just get a bunch of first entries the market keeps pushing lower keeps pushing lower and keeps pushing over another correction you would expect stronger one and didn't happen another leg down so it's starting to be obvious that the downtrend is continuing no correction is significant it basically strongly reverses backblow EMA notice v-shape reversal down no lower high Felts again too long you should reversal down to the bottom so once you see multiple major
(14:54) highs reversing down that's when you're going to start to look for a little bit stronger downtrend because this channel is just not enough okay you keep creating multiple pushes on your extreme so as you can see this looks like a spike and kind of like a channel working over you spike down you're working a little because if I'm going to look for not Spike on the channel and why the channel like this I basically don't get any swing confirmation I only get two swings no three swing confirmation so this right here
(15:23) is the proper pattern is going to copy it put it at the bottom oops I'm just going to delete it and you can see you can predict this second entry short now this is very Advanced to take you can also see that you have a triple top smaller train range you have a break and new extreme for this uptrend and you have new low first entry short second entry short and two key entry points are merging here the resistance and this trend line that just now is getting confirmed I'm gonna mark it I was on my break it's definitely more advanced but it is
(16:01) following the price session and the price action rules because the context is bearish you have two key entry points the uptrend played out and it's a second entry short now the market continue pushing lower you can see we have overshoot but it was so tiny I extended it a little bit as you can see it eventually you get another push here so get confirmation here confirmation here but I get another overshoot and you can see that we already moved quite a bit down and this is where your instinct will kick in that you're a little bit
(16:33) flustered for not taking a lot of setups because today despite the fact that we have a very strong sell-off very few setups basically no good setup here if you miss this setup the only great setup you pretty much are left completely dry so Traders will start forcing setups and they will bend the market to their will but the market doesn't care about us at all and just because you didn't take a setup you know the market doesn't take this into consideration it basically doesn't care a lot of times Traders will
(17:03) completely disregard how the market is behaving that you move so far down for such a long time the trend is starting to be a little bit overextended you even have a little overshoot here you know there's eventually time for some profit taking for some Bulls to pick bottom and start buying and you can see that this is exactly what is happening you can see notice EMA is suddenly rejecting and not a single candle is managing to stay below EMA significantly and compare this correction how EMA keeps holding every single time to this
(17:39) EMA is not holding so EMA is not holding sell-off EMA is not holding sell-off EMA is not holding sell-off EMA is not holding self here notice EMA is holding once again significantly it is because the overshoot prior to this EMA is not holding solo and EMA is basically not holding because it's getting rejected so you can see that suddenly these Corrections have v-shaped reversals and now we can see continuous bullish momentum you can see that the prices confirm the channel again so Strong football EMA first century long which we
(18:12) don't have a trigger below low high but at this instance we would not want to see lower high because we have the continuous bullish momentum and we have a felt attacking in Geelong but notice once again one two three four five bars stacked even in release bars you know quite aggressive I will mark it as aggressive but just nothing formed that clean at least the single bar is pretty good and then you can see smaller support being formed here being formed here Yemen getting flat and the market completely lost him because it's about to get close
(18:44) we don't be trading this late regardless we didn't really go bar by bar as we normally do there really weren't that many great setups but I hope you find the technical aspect overall quite useful because it is pretty much how price session likes to move and remember here pick a pattern generally takes precedence over the small one especially if you have the first trend for the day to start with where you don't have multiple conflicting patterns so I'm gonna wrap it up and I'm gonna see you guys the next one take care everybody




(270) 3 Factors That Will Help You Filter The BEST Trades - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpdD-Tifcok

Transcript:
(00:00) there are three important factors that we need to keep in back of our minds when we are trying to find the safest and the most high probability setups in trading and that would be first we need to identify what is the market structure meaning what is the current bias then we need to locate the proper key entry point meaning trendline support resistance line or exponential moving average this is the blue line 21 ema and then we need to identify what is the behavior around these key entry points meaning is there a second entry the
(00:34) second entry is a higher probability setup combined with these two okay and this would be the price action that i would see when i would open my chart today so the first thing i need to do i need to identify the structure and structure is what it is looking bullish we are making higher highs high lows we're above the ema so i'm going to locate the key entry point of these first two swings this is how you normally find the trend line and the third swing confirmed it i put it to the side and market is working higher i have overshoot over
(01:02) trend line and overshoot a lot of times lead to breakover trendline and after price will break the trend line according to trendline rules traders will attempt to make a new extreme new high so i'm waiting for price to make its way on a new high but at the same time i have a resistance here okay so i have a second entry short of the resistance but at the same time i'm waiting for a new high so i have a two conflicting beliefs here so what i'm going to do i'm just going to sit on my hands and be patient all right as you guys can see
(01:32) market have a doji and i have a big move up okay and this means that the price action this bullish uptrend played out with the break price finally created a new extreme and the uptrend is over according to rules and what we have next a big bearish bar so when i'm watching this at this big bearish bar and we close below the ema it's definitely starting to look like a change of a trend and bearish momentum what do we have next next big bullish bar big bearish bar bearish bar and another bearish bar okay so what i need to do
(02:11) three factors i'm going to identify the structure looking bearish we're coming off the resistance i'm going to locate the key entry point i don't have enough price action to find me a bigger pattern okay so i need to just start with drawing the shortened trend lines and i need to identify the behavior when i'm in a downtrend which this seems like it's going to be a downtrend because we're coming off the highs we're below ema i'm looking for second entry longs and i'm looking for excuse me i'm looking for second entry shorts
(02:40) because it's a high priority so i'm at the key entry point and i'm looking for failed second entry longs this is the new high first century long pull back second entry long failure but it didn't trigger and you're far away from ema so i'm singing my hands okay so what do i have next a big bullish bar so it's starting to be fairly confusing now i have another bullish bar and i have a bearish bar i'm not taking this bar right now because this is just a first entry this is the first attempt by the bears after this bullish leg up
(03:07) to go short i don't want to go long structure's looking bearish but this is confusing and price pushed above the ema and we just confirmed the bounce of this resistance so look at this once again i have a two conflicting patterns here price keeps pushing above the ema which is a sign that the trend is changing once again from bearish to bullish but we're coming off the resistance and remember uptrend played out so i don't want to go long but i don't want to go short either we have a nice bench bar we now have a first
(03:37) century short second entry short which is a high probability setup at the key entry point this resistance but you have two patterns but look what happened price started rallying up lower and lower all right this would be aggressive entry but when you're watching this live this is starting to look like a train range you want to be patient and look what happened next when i was watching market pushing lower and pushing lower below ema i tried to find a bigger key entry point you may be wondering thomas why are you finding a wider pattern why
(04:11) are you not satisfied with the shortened one because if you take a look this structure is looking way too big for this shortened trend line in comparison okay there's much more price action than the shortened train this is way too short and we're too tight take a look here this is a good enough price action for shortened trend line you have a break and a new low and this is very tiny with the move this move however is extremely big and we moved a lot of points down so it means there has to be a bigger pattern this is why i'm not satisfied with the
(04:45) shortened trend line and i'm going to draw the bigger one the move is just way too big for the short term one to play any significant role in this so as the market keeps working lower keeps working lower structure is bearish i got my key entry point right here and i'm waiting for a high probability to set up the behavior okay i'm no longer interested in buying we're definitely coming off the resistance laid out so i'm interested in selling we have a bullish correction we have a first century long i'm going to draw my trend line we have
(05:15) a first entry short the felt and pullback we have a second entry short once i see this i'm expecting a second entry short of two kmg points this is what i was expecting when i was watching this chart live first century short secondary short we have a second entry short trigger but below bullish bar remember when we are going short we want to sell below bearish bars when we are going long we want to buy above bullish bars we don't want to sell even though it's two key entry points this is extremely bullish signal bar
(05:49) i'm sitting on my hands patiently i have the shortened treatment working higher because i need to find and respect even the shorter term trend lines and look what happens next once again two conflicting patterns i have a big downtrend i have a first break of this big downtrend so i'm expecting a new extreme but at the same time price broke above the ema and we keep pushing higher this looks bullish overall structure however is bearish and bigger pattern always takes precedence so i'm not thinking long i'm not thinking short because we're
(06:20) about ama i'm being patient all right what do i have next bearish bar oh oh oh oh a gigantic bearish move load there is no way to enter we have a clear break and we have a clear new low and when i see a break and you'll remember the price section trendline rule after a break there will be a new extreme after a break there will be a new extreme you even have a little break of this uptrend and a new high new extreme note here write it down to a notepad look how far away price is away from ema ema acts as a magnet and keeps pulling
(06:56) prices closer to it when i was watching this live i was honestly contemplating buying the market here after break and a new low this is looking like a big depletion move down and you're so far away from ema i didn't pull the trigger here i was really contemplating with the idea though playing with the idea of going along here i have a bullish bar i have a bullish bar i'm going to draw my trend line and look what we have here first entry short and we keep pushing lower all right so not only we have new one new low we
(07:27) have another new low and what i was expecting here i was expecting reversal pattern i was expecting a break above the ema and continuation working higher so once you keep making new lows and you lose you know generally what that means probably a bigger pattern in play all right so keep that in back of your mind so as i'm watching this we're starting to bounce and work higher all right remember when i'm watching is the downtrend played out so in back of my mind i'm expecting still price to either go correction or straight up
(07:58) reverse so i'm going to draw my trend line once again like like this all right i'm going to draw my trend line i have a first entry short but i don't want to go short because the downtrend played out i've moved higher looks like we're broken above ema but oh second entry short so look at this second entry short extremely tempting to go short but the downtrend played out and i need to follow the trendline rules okay but at the same time i don't want to go long either because we already have a break and a new high so the uptrend played out as well
(08:33) so the next bar is bearish and the next bar is bullish once again extremely tempting to go short but i can't extreme tempting to go long i can't why can't i go long here by this time this is a congestion we have one two three four five six seven eight bar going sideways and how i know this is a congestion ema is flat in the middle of those bars look what happened next a lower high setup huge confusion here but look what happened here we're supposed to go higher and there is no reversal pattern there's strong rejection at the ema and there is almost
(09:12) no bullish presence in the market this is where i made my bigger channel something like this because clearly we are not reversing we are not working higher so remember identify structure bearish locate key entry point trend line behavior of the market congestion lower high setup and then price keeps pushing over we have a tiny breakout pullback and then this is the new high first century long second inch long remember i'm looking for second entry shorts and once we have a swing at the key entry point i'm looking for felt
(09:48) second entry longs because people are going to get trapped going long in downtrend this is the new high first century long second entry long this is where i took my first short for today i shared it with the community you all saw it uh here i had a little bit of a slippage and i just had a manual error this happens extremely rarely but it happened when i was moving my limit order i accidentally uh my hand slipped and i moved it two ticks below the signal bar all right this happens extremely rarely but it can happen sometimes you will even buy
(10:21) instead of selling uh it happens rarely but that comes with the territory that can happen so in this instance it kind of shook me shake me off shook me off but you know i still uh hang in there and trusted the price action following my rules and this is a felt second entry long off the two key entry points the all three factors are in play market you know easy scalp and keep we keep working over we keep working lower this is definitely a downtrend now and i have a new low right here all right i have a low right here i have a
(10:54) first entry short okay i'm going to draw my trend line and i have a what looks like is going to be a second entry short remember structure key entry point behavior structure bearish key entry point two key entry points here trend line and the ema and the behavior it looks like a second entry shot when i see this i'm preparing my limit order if we get a one tick trigger below this bar bearish bar i'm taking a second entry shot because two-legged pullback is a high probability setup okay let me draw it for you guys from the bearish
(11:25) perspective two two-legged pullback is a high probably sub at the proper key entry point but we we never get triggle over a market keeps working higher tiny break new high and look what we have here first century short second entry short bearish bar we close below ema we just have a first break of this overall downtrend so i'm expecting a new extreme of this bigger downtrend all right and this is the second entry show this is my second trade for the day once again you all saw it it were a quick easy scalp and i just want to show you guys
(12:00) even though i started traded i started looking at chart extremely early today generally the trading starts after the market open which is 15 30 in europe where i am located so take it take a look market open 1530 right here this was the first trade this was the second trade 1545 15 minutes of work quick two easy trades eight contracts in total where else you can make this amount of money in just 15 minutes trading is 100 when you ask if you ask me probably the best job there is if you stick with this long enough and you
(12:35) master this up after this i was done i was enjoying my friday because fridays tend to be slow and i just don't want to push the luck too easy scalps i'm out of here then look what is happening price takes few ticks higher instantly reverse down we're still waiting for a new low this is a still big downtrend we are at the key entry point and this is a minor double top right here i'm going to mark it as an aggressive entry because the signal bar is not ideal this is just you know example trade next time you see a
(13:06) better signal bar because there's a horrible stim at the bottom and that means people started buying at the very close and you want to stay away from this okay and market quick easy scalp and look what we have next i'm not thinking in buying the entire time by the way when the second entry when this reversal pattern failed and we have a break in a new high i'm starting to only think about selling they said the new high percentage long pull back second entry long failure same thing right here first central second second
(13:34) strong failure secondary long failure this bar is quite bullish though we're getting close to these lows it worked but we don't want to push the lock the bar is a little bit too bullish and we're getting close to these lows and look what we have here finally a new extreme after break of this bigger downtrend and what that means we are expecting a correction or possibly straight up reversal look what happens i have a bullish bar i have a bearish bar but we don't have trigger yet and we keep pushing about the ema so what does that mean
(14:06) market is reversing okay market is reversing we're working higher we're working higher we have a first entry short failed and price keeps working higher okay structure reversing locate key entry point i get the shorter trendline behavior i don't have a high priority set up at this just a first century short and first century long okay market key is working and move all you have here you have a first century short second entry short failure because the next bar is bullish this is what it's called a reversal pattern but
(14:40) we are not touching the ema and we already move quite a bit and i just as i keep mentioning guys the best reversal pattern appears right after the ema and ema is holding prices you don't want to go long after all that move happened i mean you're not touching the ema you want to maximize your win percentage as much as you can so i recommend skipping this i didn't want to enter this when i was watching this live next we have a doji bar a little bit of correction and you have a uh first century long second entry long
(15:12) off the key entry point structure is definitely bullish you have a break of this uptrend so you're once again what you're expecting to make a new extreme you're not thinking short no more the downtrend played out all right the downtrend played out traders you're only thinking long now and this is a second entry long high probability set up this is the behavior do i have a key entry point i have my ema structure bullish great entry to take i'm going to mark this entry as a second entry long and now it can be a continuation of the reversal pattern
(15:41) and quick easy scalp and what do i have big bearish bar so hopefully you guys get the gist of how price keeps working am i looking for long at this point on no i'm not i'm not looking for longs now why i have a break at a new high so i'm just sitting on my hands if i get have a good short setup reverse the pattern i may take it what do i have a little bit of a lackluster price action we have a percentage long failure but this is the first entry long look where we're pushing lower so i'm gonna find a shortened trend line
(16:13) but we're pushing below ema and uptrend played out so it's normal for me to look for shorts i have a second entry long i'm not taking this option played out second entry long failure we have a break of the short-run trend line so we're waiting for a new low i'm going to mark it as an aggressive setup for advanced traders because we closed above the ema what you want to see when you're selling the reversal pattern you want for price to close below the ema you would just push slightly higher but an advanced trader
(16:42) can look at the overall context and recognize that the context is so strong here to take a sell and quick easy sculpt all right and i'm not thinking and selling no more because i have a first lag pull back second leg i have a break and a new low and price keeps working higher so even though i haven't now bearish bar here i am not thinking selling and think about this you may be wondering thomas why are you not making the channel wider now because the shortened trend line is now fits in comparison to these moves
(17:14) these two legs are tiny if you take a look here this overall these two legs are extremely big to just be satisfied with the shortened trend line okay so the bigger the move the wider the pattern and the wider the channel i use and we have a first entry short pull back second entry short and look what happened you have a shorter trend line you take one tick lower and instantly reverse on one single bar first entry short second entry short failure big bullish bar you closed above the ema this is a gorgeous trap after downtrend
(17:51) played out and you want to take this too close above the ema so look at this structure once again bullish because the downtrend played out key entry point we are above the ema behavior felt second entry short trap a lot of people are gonna go short after this downtrend played out the market keeps working keeps working and you finally scout out okay we keep working higher we keep working higher we keep making you high so what i'm going to do i'm gonna maybe there's a wider channel because we keep making new highs keep making new highs
(18:23) but now it started to be really confusing because now i have this resistance but i have a bullish bus in market look what i have market keeps working higher we're about the ema for the majority of the time this was a two legged correction but we have a strong resistance so it is tempting to sell and tempting to buy this is a watch pattern so i recommend not doing anything here just be it's much better to not take a chance and be patient we have a first break of this now option because we keep making you highs we can make you guys we keep
(19:00) making you guys high new high attempt to make a new high felt first century long failure will build with me so i'm going to draw my shortened trend line copy it put it down here at the bottom so right now the ch trend is changing and we have a first century long second inch long failure okay even if i don't have this trend line which is okay i cannot go short here and why i cannot go short here because i'm going short directly into this down trend line can you guys see this i'm going short after all that moved down and there is
(19:34) no room i would be way overshooting the downtrend that's not okay so even though this is a felt second entry long coming off the resistance i cannot go short directly into this trend line the market keeps working higher keeps working higher we made another swing so there's a definitely bullish bus you have a first entry short second entry short and look at this extremely tempting resistance is holding but there is a bullish uptrend so i cannot take a chance here i it would have worked for a scalp i don't know what's going to happen i
(20:05) have a break of the shortened downtrend break new low perfect price action so you're probably expecting for price to move higher so you're looking for felt secondary short you're pushing above oh and you push way too higher and there is no reversal pattern there is a first century long second entry long right here and market keeps working higher keeps working higher so these are the three factors that you guys need to keep in mind when you're looking at the chart it looks confusing but when you go bar by bar it might it really makes sense and
(20:39) it's not that hard and hopefully you guys find the video useful keep studying during the weekend enjoy the weekend and i'm gonna talk to you guys in the next video so bye

(00:00) price action is representation of price movement of every instrument if you want to dissect the information that the candles the price action is telling you if you want to identify the right places on a chart to enter you need to be aware of three important factors these three factors you always want to keep in back of your mind every single time you're doing your analysis on price chart number one what is the overall Market structure number two do I have a key entry point because it is a significant place where most of the high product
(00:30) setups will form and is there a high probability setup how is the price action reacting what is the behavior at the key entry point so when I'm observing structure like this I have to go through all these factors ask myself a couple of questions notice I have channels drawn on a chart and this is pivotal because I want to follow the trendline rule because there is a rule that says after there's a break I expect for Price session to create new extremes so we can see dungeon working over braking low up to working higher break
(00:56) new high down to working lower brake new low and here we can see that the price section is moving in pairs of twos and this is important because Market never goes straight up or straight down in these v-shaped formations there is always some form of a correction and Market likes to move in pairs of twos if something fails once Traders will not give up they will try to do it again so this is why the tool I get pullback is so powerful so here we have interpretation of the two-legged pullback price session is however
(01:22) trending back above the EMA now I have only one indicator supportive indicator is the supportive EMA 12 marks bench moving average and since we're above the EMA this is right now tell me okay the structure is more bullish because sellers they never reverse the market we're back above EMA this is the new high where I am going to reset the count from because right now I'm thinking more bullish and notice what we have new high first time to go long trigger below pullback second attempt to go along if there's going to be a break Above This tier one
(01:52) single bar you may held ones emailed twice remember the trailer will we need to get new high and because we are above the EMA this is confirming the bullish bias and we have a great second entry long that is also a failed second entry short counting from this low this is the lowest level of the correction I forced them to sell pull back second attempt to sell failure so two high quality setups in one and Market keeps working higher and notice the price session keeps trending higher so what is the price session tell me well remember what is
(02:23) the market structure since I can see breaking you high I would expect stronger reversal didn't happen the push above game May confirm okay you have bullish bias so right now I expect stronger bullish bias because price session keeps working hard regardless of the first channel getting a break in your extreme so this is what I'm going to redraw another Channel because you always want to find a channel I'm also looking for some bigger pattern because this feels like there's a bigger Trend in play but I don't have that much information just
(02:49) yet so I'm just going to follow the shortening channels as the price session keeps developing you don't have to find your channel right away you can wait for Price session to develop more and with more price action it is much easier for you to collect the information here to collect the information there and put the pieces together and locate the right Channel okay we are not full at the EMA the price session is developing we're breaking the channel so I expect for Price session to create new stream remember to turn louder we talked about
(03:13) this at the very beginning so I won't take the tool I get pulled back because I have the context which is bullish I have the key entry point EMA but what is the behavior I only have first century loan I want to see the tool I get pullback okay the two-legger pullback would be the high product setup can we get it and we already got the first entry long they already created new extreme okay so no big deal I will just wait for another chance to enter for another correction break section keeps developing we have a
(03:39) new extreme side natural expect stronger correction I'm drawing the shortened channels also for these Corrections okay because there's a trend being present but there are also small Trends within every single main Trend so always hold the trend I really will break new extreme and price session is reversing above EMA this is pivotal this is resuming the bullish bias again and this confirms our initial analysis that there may be why the channel so how this structure looks if I'm going to look for Chan like this
(04:07) note this I have so much MTM at the top you already have a small break new high so this is not really helpful but this looks to me like a spike and a channel that is developing so what I'm going to do I'm going to connect the first two swings something like this I'm just going to play around with it so I get the most confirmations we're getting confirmation here confirmation here and here comes the sweet part if I'm going to copy it I'm going to put it at the top notice the confirmation at the top notice Market geometry is real notice these
(04:35) highs how they are working higher allowing me to spot this channel here and here so this is telling me that this Spike any channel is valid and there's always a reason to practice one there are always channels being present on the chart trend lines are not subjective that doesn't mean that you will find the right trend line every single time or sometimes you may be way off finding the right channel but it doesn't mean that the channel is not there it's just much harder to find so we have new low this is the lowest level correction just like
(04:59) here I used to reset the count so this is the law I'm going to reset the count we have first attempt to sell we're pushing above EMA so what am I expecting felt second entry short because I've structure it is bullish I have key entry point I'm at the EMA and I have the channel and I expect the second entry short failure we have a field secondary short but it is way too far from the EMA and this is why I use EMA it helps me to measure distance if it's okay to go long this time it worked but next time it will take it it will not work so even
(05:26) though it's the first second too short I cannot take micro double tap resist account in price action so I'm gonna use the second tab the double tap to start my account over again I have first entry long EMA is holding confirming the bullish bias and notice what we have we have a second entry long but this is not the only information that price action is giving me I can also see that we have triple test forming one bottom double bottom here prices came back and tested it again so you have second entry long and we have
(05:57) triple test the first thing Lamar where the second entry long triggered was this horrible doji bar so I cannot go long Above This Bar but once I see this strong bullish bar I can enter this as a double bar entry if I'm gonna get a break Above This Bar I can consider this triggered drop my limit order and put my stop loss one thick below the single bar it is a little bit more congestive I try to take this set up myself but I use my limiter 2 3 ticks back due to the congestion and it never came back but you can see
(06:25) structure clearly bullish what is the key entry point you got the main Channel and you got the EMA you got the triple test and what is the behavior the behavior is that the buyers are coming to the market because EMA is not letting price action close lower okay this is the correction phase attempt to create new stream are you concerned that you don't have full new low for the down to noses we keep drawing this downtrend same thing I'm gonna do here that's not the big of a deal because there's a temp renewal an attempt is considered for us
(06:53) enough because the triple test is coming into play and buyers deal this price level worthy so the new low cannot be made due to the overwhelming of buying pressure so it's a great high priority setup as well but you will have to be fast and more importantly there was no pullback with the limit order unfortunately I think you have to use due to the congestion and at this point the trend is much stronger so for this reason I can be taking more aggressive setups and you can see price session keeps developing new high
(07:20) so I'm going to redraw the downtrend again break new extreme great I have a breaking low and you have to like a pullback so you can already see how price action works during a bullish Trend there's a push fade there's a correction phase I'm not particularly panicking once I miss something and I can see price action working higher that's okay I'm just gonna wait my turn I'm gonna wait for Price session to pull back all the way to the key entry point in the form of a tool like a pullback and this is exactly what is happening
(07:45) new high for essential long brake lower we're interested in buying for Central long down to in play second and too long and you can see that we have the two like a pullback and this is exactly what I'm looking for just gonna quickly go here we have another first leg down break second leg down we can also see the gun like a first leg here and the second leg was much shorter so there are variations of two like I pulled back here there is not such a color to like a pullback but it's okay just because something doesn't
(08:12) happen every single time that doesn't mean they're not repeatable patterns nothing in trading is 100 repeatable you're looking for Clues you're looking for similarities you're looking for patterns that tend to repeat over and over again on long enough statistical basis so nothing is 100 you don't have to have the exact repeat pattern but you're finding the nuances that help you find consistency if a new high for essential long pull back second and too long at the key entry point at the trendline so it doesn't get any easier
(08:38) great hypothe setup great second entry long T1 signal bar remember Market structure Factor one clearly bullish series of higher silos what is our key entry point the trend line in the EMA and the behavior of the market is telling me okay glitter like a pullback create you one single bar this is a great textbook second entry long but here's a little kicker it was right around the news which means me personally when I was watching this I was not taking a setup here this was a big bummer because it doesn't get any
(09:10) easier and also you can see we have another high quality setup y because it's a high low confirmation setup of this tool like a pullback Halo confirming the tool I get pullback and we are still at two key entry points and still off the main trend line but because we were exactly around the news unfortunately I skipped but because it's such a great setup you know actually you can take the risk on a higher low because it's telling you that the news are not that significant and Hilo is always safe confirmation setup despite
(09:36) the fact that we have news you can actually risk it right here on the high low and Market continue working higher new high for essential long second entry long no trigger inside bar far away from EMA okay I'm not interested you can see the second inch long never triggered install the inside bar and overall it is far from the EMA I'm gonna rejoice and downtrend and notice what I have first leg down second leg down once again a dookie entry points the signal bar is fairly doji-ish but the tail at the bottom is telling me if the bar
(10:05) looked very bearish and reverse strongly bullish am I to worry about this not really because this is still decent bullish momentum bar great second entry actually this is a double trap because the micro second inch long form bad double travel form when something is wrong with the second entry it's either far from the EMA it's too congested the dungeons in play so all the early buyers will get trapped but all the people who are selling the Felts Academy Long against the trend they're gonna get trapped as well either way you can see
(10:33) two key entry points and visual two like a pullback if something looks like it's like a pullback you can trust it dungeon has a break new extreme great High product setup and basically a textbook repeat pattern What's Happening Here you put your establish one thing below the single bar so you're not panicking don't ever move your stop-loss thinking because sometimes Traders they see this bullish bar and they think okay I'm gonna get Scott they're very positive and they see this bearish bar and suddenly it it shifts and they start
(10:58) doubting themselves this is where trading is manual a lot of times Traders this is very common Traders will actually enter the good trade but there are many demons will actually talk them out of this just because the market is not rallying off exactly within one second as you expected that doesn't mean that your analysis changed you have to go through the thought process why you like the trade in the first place how is the key entry point how's the single bar so just because Market reversed here remember you keep your stop loss one
(11:26) tick below the single bar so you're not really worried you cannot close it prematurely if you find yourself closing trades prematurely you haven't accepted the idea that the trade may be a losing trade and you need to accept it because on every single trade you may pick a wrong one market can reverse it can happen nobody can predict the future and you have to accept the losing trade never move your stop loss never exit early you can exit early once there is a very long congestion but this is not the case Market continue
(11:51) working higher I'm going to zoom back a little bit so you can see the overall structure you can see you always wait for Price session to correct for the correction phase to end you're going through this checklist and you want to take the high probability setup you can see at the key entry point this is the place where all the high priority setups will form and this is where you want to be buying it is counterintuitive because you're buying low you're not buying High you are buying low but you're trusting the price action rules and you can see
(12:17) the trend is losing Steam one trade already asked me why did I go along with this double check I actually sell myself for quick easy scalp am I too worried about loss of momentum not really because this was a double trap and double trap basically is like a high low confirmation tip if this was Ordinary second inch long I would probably skip I'll be probably afraid of the loss of momentum but we can see each bullish push face is smaller and smaller it is losing Steam we are only hacking this trend line so we can roll over so for this reason I'm
(12:45) not thinking about buying any more because we're about to roll over we're only hanging the trend line we can't even make it to the midline not even you know a little bit higher price session is working lower now what am I thinking remember the trailer rule after a break we expect for Price action to create new extreme for this main uptrend so I'm thinking about push-up of EMA and a hollow or felt second entry short preferably first secondary short because the downtrend is still in play okay we're backlog EMA I'm not buying as
(13:16) long as we build EMA and the dungeon is still in play I cannot be buying just yet also you can see we have first leg down so the Bears probably have this target the second leg down and once I see flat EMA and consistent price swings up and down up and down this is where I already tried to predict where the key level is going to be so I'm going to put it at the top train range am I playing this is a train range no I'm not selling might be buying at the bottom because you trade it up but this option needs to get new high so
(13:44) I'm just using this to let me know when it's okay to go long break new extreme and all downtrends reach new extreme our first one this one and even the secondary one and you can see visual tool I get pullback and notice what we have triple bottom one bottom double bottom triple Bottom now I like to call Triple test mainly a local price action setup more supportive so I wouldn't really call it a triple test this is more like a triple bottom but you can definitely go long here because everything has a new extreme to like a pullback you're
(14:16) right at the support where the buyers are coming to the market key and triple once again structure right now is more train range but it's with the bullish bias you got the key entry point you get the support and behavior is good too like a pullback new low and decent enough bar if you're unsure you want to wait for high low above EMA or fault secondary short we have high low but it's below EMA so I can't really take it by the time I get a full second entry short once again super far from the EMA I still expect new high of this uptrend
(14:43) you cannot be selling because this option is to get new have you been trying hard the entire day so even if you're playing in the Thai Channel you cannot be selling always respect the overall bullish trend and we finally created a new extreme for the main uptrend but price action is not behaving that way and we continue working out so this is where I decided to widen my channel a little bit like this because this is a lot of times how strong Trend will continue you have a break new high but price session is rarely correcting and now we have
(15:14) another tool like a pullback problem here though is that we're not full at the EMA EMA I can't really take it sometimes they work yes but sometimes they fail and you don't want to be guessing you don't be gambling you want to take something that you're comfortable with so if you're more you know taking risk here you can take the second entry along but I really recommend the patient because there's a lot of times for double trap forms it is right off the wider channel so you know why not but it's a little bit more
(15:46) aggressive okay now we're way too far to decide just the first entry line are interested now we have too much congestion by bar so I'm just waiting price action reverse is lower okay this is interesting and this is where the structure is not clear this is where the three factors are not being fulfilled because if I'm going to zoom back our main option has a breaking high and we're right now going choppy so I cannot really put the finger on the price action now this is where you basically have to be honest objective and admit the fact that you
(16:21) know it's not too clear what's gonna happen it was clear all the way up everything here is clear Perfect Price action and now it's not that easy to decipher what the price session is telling me it will resume there's going to be once again easy pattern but I want to be sure we have a hollow here but the hollow is double bar entry you know not the clear don't really feel that great about this I was thinking that the market will go higher I was looking for a higher low above EMA because the second entry along with blue EMA can't take it but we never
(16:46) push the buff EMA with higher low and Market continue working lower so I'm going to redraw shorten downtrend okay and finally the structure is getting better Market structure is a downtrend key entry point we have the trendline behavior I'm looking forward to like a pullback and we only have first entry short another first entry short two likes to an extreme and Market is reversing so this entire dungeon was fairly strong EMA pointing down but no way for me to capitalize only just first century short first entry short you know first century
(17:19) short unfortunately camera the entities first leg down break second leg down Market continues working here I'm going to redraw short and uptrend once again no pullback to the key entry point so I can't really go long I have to respect these areas where nothing is happening we have a small break new high but there is in price action a little bit new when you want if I can see massive blue Spike and I can see breaking you high and we didn't touch EMA prior to making breaking high this is a lot of times resulting into
(17:51) additional bullish continuation because this was such a massive Spike and you never touch the EMA so buyers are not considering this new high valid and they want to see kind of like a legit push so we have first entry long failed second entry loan but everything is so stick can I get a hollow I can't get Halo we have a legitimate new high Market reverse lower and reverse back up so it is not that clear price action keeps working higher we have first century long we have a second inch long but it's too far up
(18:24) almost double top it's way too wide you can see the body is so far from the EMA only the tail touch did you cannot enter when I was watching this I was thinking about possible wider uptrend like this but the problem is we don't have third swing confirmation so when I don't have third swing confirmation and the option is not weak we still have decent bearish pullbacks I would like to see some confirmation so I've had the second into long form close to the EMA so you have room to get out before reaching this swing high you can
(18:52) consider but not like this especially since the uptrend is not fully confirmed Market keeps reversing I'm gonna redraw the shortened downtrend but if only first century short and now it's getting way too late and the market is closing these are the three main important factors that you always want to combine you always want them to be met you don't want to be guessing you don't make gambling you have to remain objective so you understand what exactly is happening of course there are other ways how to read the price session there are more
(19:20) advanced setups but it's way more for advanced Traders these are three main factors that you need to master as a developing Trader good luck with your Trading

Transcript:
(00:00) a complete guide to candlestick pattern trading understanding candlestick patterns goes far beyond just memorizing certain formations it is a method to read a price chart right now we're looking at raw data pure and naked price action if we strip everything off the chart and this is the most important information for trader that tells you everything you need to know about the intentions of all other market participants what the buyers and sellers are thinking who is in control and what is the future direction of the market by understanding what the candlesticks are
(00:31) telling you you can get better understanding of price movement we can identify where on the chart is increase in buying pressure or selling pressure if there is indecision in the market or how strong the momentum is or if there's exhaustion of certain price movement every small price change matters nothing is random in price session and therefore knowing what to look for on each candle is paramount to achieve consistent profitability candlesticks are representation of price movement they basically depict the tug of war between
(01:01) two sides buyers and sellers who is in control of the market who has the momentum on their side and future potential direction of the market candlesticks visually present four important data points all traders need to pay attention to open high low and close bullish candle is indicating prices going up bearish candle is indicating prices going down bullish candle has opening price lower than the closing price indicating rise in buying pressure and bearish candle has opening price higher than the closing price
(01:38) indicating bearish pressure the wicks at the bottom are indicating the lowest price prices reached while the bar was forming and upper wicks are indicating highest price prices reached while the bars were forming so the bullish candle presented open at this particular level traded down ended up trading higher all the way to the highest price point but towards the close managed to trade a little bit lower and close at this particular level therefore the body has wicks on each side and it is important to pay attention to all parts of the candlesticks bodies and wicks and it's
(02:19) important for you as a trader to also pay attention how the bar is forming because it can tell you a lot about the momentum it can tell you a lot about how the candlestick is reacting to important key level and because candlesticks can change in a split second start of a candle at the bottom here looks like a very strong bearish bar but towards the end there was increase in buying pressure and the bar closed like this so you can never take your eyes off the candle while it is forming it is important for you to witness the candle
(02:52) start and end it is important for you to see the final picture of the candle so you know what you're working with if it is okay to buy or sell to move forward it is essential to understand basic concepts of candlestick patterns such as bodies and wicks because the body of a candle can tell us a lot about strength and weaknesses of buyers and sellers the candle to the left we can see it opened and it started with minimal selling pressure but towards the close buyer stepped in immense buying pressure happened and bar managed to close way above the open indicating very strong
(03:29) bullish body that is much bigger than the initial bearish tail this right here is indicating a very strong bullish bar and this is a strong buying pressure good for bulls the next bar open started with minimal buying pressure but instantly sellers stepped in took over the market immense selling pressure happened and the body is extremely bearish way bigger than the initial tail this is indicating strong selling pressure and this is a very good bar for the sellers on the other hand we can see when the body is small relative to the
(04:01) candle it can tell us that the pressure is not that strong for example this bar right here opened and it looked promising for the bulls we trade up higher buyers raised price to a new high but sellers at this particular level stepped in took the price down yes the buyers managed to close the price above the open but it is so insignificant this is not a good sign for the bulls and this would be a very weak bullish bar so it is important to pay attention to what the candle did while it was forming and how it closed so you can see the candle lift and deplete similarly the next
(04:40) candle it started promising for the sellers strong selling pressure at one point this entire bar looked very bearish but towards the close buyers stepped in raised the price up and the selling pressure was so minimal that this would be not a good bar for sellers to consider selling so it is important to understand the size of a body relative to the wick but just because the tail is much bigger than the wick it doesn't mean that the pressure is weak actually if there's a large tail below bull body it indicates strong buying pressure and it is a good sign for bulls this is what we call bullish tail large
(05:18) tail above bare body indicates strong bearish pressure and this is what we call bearish tail a lot of times candlesticks like these are a good indication of momentum if you have solid key level upon reaching the key level you can see massive momentum to the upside and massive momentum to the downside the wick at the bottom adds pressure to the buyers and wick at the top adds pressure to the sellers basic concepts of candlestick patterns what is important to remember is that candlestick patterns work and
(05:52) they remain the same across all time frames the characteristics you will learn about candlesticks and candlestick patterns they're applicable in every single market and on all time frames the only difference is the duration of the candlestick itself so for example on 2,00 tick chart one candlestick on a chart it opens and after 2,00 transaction it will close and a brand new candlestick will print after that on five minute chart it takes 5 minutes of price movement price is oscillating up and up and down or going up or straight down it takes 5 minutes from the open to
(06:32) the close and then a next bar can print and on a daily chart it takes entire day for one candlestick to print and the next day a brand new candlestick will form no matter the time frame no matter the market the candlestick analysis remains the same while doing the candlestick analysis is very important what we have to remember is that candlestick formations and patterns they're just one component of a successful trade because a high probability trade setup consists of market context key entry point price
(07:07) action pattern and the candlestick pattern is the last piece of confirmation you don't have to learn and memorize all of these retail candlestick formations because these candlestick formations without a good context and without a good reason to take a setup are not that helpful and they will not improve your win rate these candlestick formations alone without a good pattern to support it are not helpful you want to make trading simple and more importantly you want to understand how candlesticks work in its purest form you want to understand what the candlesticks
(07:40) are telling you what is the momentum what is the pressure which side is in control in the market etc so it's better to focus on the candlestick analysis in depth so you understand exactly what the market in front of you is telling you we already discussed this but we're going to go through this now as a summary three key factors in analyzing a single bar size of the single bar matters a single bar that is big is indicating good pressure good momentum but if the single bar is excessively big if the candle is excessively big and you want to enter a position your risk
(08:12) naturally increases and your stop loss is much bigger so also that is a factor you need to take into consideration because if the bar is too big you simply cannot enter because it violates your money management rules and the signal bar is very small and neutral there is a lack of pressure and it's not confirming your trade setup we're paying attention to the body because the body reflects the difference between the open and the close if there's a candle that is closing on its high or its low that's
(08:37) indicating good momentum and you're paying attention to tails or wicks because they're showing possible rejection or reversal on the candlestick trend bars are very strong bars that are confirming current trend and current momentum the bullish bar is indicating strong buying pressure closing on its very high without a tell this is a very strong bullish bar and bearish trend bar is opening at the top strong selling pressure this is a very strong bearish bar reversal bars have significant tail either at the bottom or at the top so
(09:08) we're talking about bullish reversal bar initially there was selling pressure the bar look bearish but buyers stepped in around this price level reversed the market higher and the entire concept of this candle changes and now the tug of war is clear buyers completely took over sellers are insignificant this is indicating great reversal strong reversal pressure same thing for the bearish bar initial buying pressure eventually sellers stepped in market reversed all the way back down closed right here but then we also have dogee
(09:39) bars dogey bars they have tails significant tails at both sides it's some variation and they have very tiny bodies they may have one or two ticks bearish body or bullish body or they may have no body neutral body like this these candlesticks mainly indicate indecision both buyers and sellers are equally strong these are neutral bars these are not good signal bars you want to see if you want to enter a position in the market many times once we see a lot of dogey bars sting right next to each other this is indicating a congestion area in the market which means this is pretty much no trade zone
(10:13) it is very easy to have a losing trade once you have many dogey bars sting right next to each other so this is something to keep in back of your mind how to recognize which candlestick is the best candlestick for signal bar meaning if we want to enter a position in the market we want to have a good candlestick pattern that confirms our analysis and that can confirm the direction in which we want to enter the position the candlestick tier list is something I think about every single time I'm anticipating a potential setup
(10:43) i do this automatically i don't think about this in my head i basically do this automatically at this point this is very easy to do you will learn it to do it fairly quickly it's not really as complicated as it may seem when we're trading a bad candlestick if we can avoid it can help us avoid losing trades and if we can see a good candlestick good sign bar it can help us confirm that we're reading the structure correctly and the trade may be a good trading opportunity so we have multiple tiers of these candlesticks we're talking about bullish candlesticks tier
(11:13) one represents the strongest signal bars for long setups candlesticks in tier one are ideal they exhibit great strong momentum and minimal weakness minimum bearish pressure you can see the bars these ones are ideal strong bullish bodies tails at the bottom bullish tails at the bottom and almost no bearish pressure at the top very tiny tails at the top we want bars to be closing on it's very high if you want to go long so these are ideal signal bars we want to enter a position in the market tier 2 is
(11:44) still a solid tier the candlesticks remain strong for long entries however as you can see they start to show minor weakness compared to tier 1 both of these tiers are still suitable for entry we don't really have to over complicate things too much is the tier three and four when we really have to be selective and it really matters what is the market context because you can see tier three now you're starting to have weak bullish bodies weak bullish tails and you're starting to have decent bearish wicks and even some slight bearish bodies
(12:17) these candlesticks show lack of momentum no buying pressure or very minimal buying pressure this is not what we want to see if you want to go long sometimes when you see a signal bar when it's between tier two and three you can still consider it for entry but you have to make sure the context is good okay market context is the most important thing when it comes to trading so sometimes we can take a weaker tier of the signal bar to enter a position if the context is really good key entry point is strong and confirm ideally you want these signal bars tier one and two
(12:50) but still you can work with tier three if the context is really really clear and you understand what the market is telling you and tier four it's basically neutral dogee patterns you can see lack of momentum indecision these are not great signal bars we can enter a position once you can see a single bar like this you pretty much have to avoid because you may end up having a losing trade because these single bars are showing no momentum whatsoever the same thing the same logic you will apply when it comes to bearish candlestick tier list you want to see nice bearish bodies closing on its low tails at the top
(13:22) indicating great reversal once you can see small bullish bodies tells at the bottom this is when you can see and analyze increase in buying pressure the candlestick is getting weaker and weaker and you have to make sure you're reading the context correctly and tier four once again do neutral bias increase in buying pressure you want to skip so every single time I'm watching a chart I'm doing my analysis I'm drawing key entry points and I can see pattern on the chart forming I want to see a good tier when it comes to signal bar because I want to confirm that there is enough
(13:54) buyers or sellers in the market that I can ride the wave with them and I can have a winning trade it's important to analyze the candlestick when it comes to taking a setup because they're telling you everything about the market participants who is in control and of course you want to take a setup when your side is in control and the pressure is strong what candlesticks reveal about markets candlesticks provide traders with valuable insights into intentions of all market participants they help us analyze market structure and overall price action when we're using the market
(14:25) geometry and overall the market structure but also candlestick patterns help us to identify high trade opportunities when it comes to taking setup itself so let's take a look to the left we can see that on the left we have series of consecutive bearish bars there is no bullish bar between almost you never get a perfect trend you always get mix of few bars but for the most part there is series of consecutive bearish bar this is indicating downtrend structure which means we expect bearish continuation this is a down working lower we can see strong bearish bodies
(14:59) closing on their low tails at the top and very minimal tails at the bottom and minimal buying pressure the main focus is on short opportunities only the market is correcting and now we can see that the 21 bars per moving average which is one of the key entry points we can see some rejection and this is when we are starting to pay attention to candlestick patterns as well we're using candlestick to identify the structure how the structure looks if the trend is strong and now we're going to observe the rejection because you can see this
(15:27) candle right here has a massive tail at the top initially we traded right into the EMA but exactly at exponential moving average sellers stepped in at the key entry point reversed market all the way down indicating nice bearish reversal bar telling me that this is a good signal bar and a lot of sellers are selling at this important kill at the 21 bar EMA expecting the downtrend continuation look at this signal bar as well looked very bullish at first we traded up but towards the close a lot of sellers sold at this 21 bar expansion
(15:57) moving average this is indicating strong selling pressure even though the body is neutral look at the massive tail at the top indicating strong bearish reversal a lot of sellers are in the market they're selling upon touching this key entry point and this is how you know you can sell with them because the candlestick is strong market continues working lower another strong rejection and market goes down same thing to the upside consecutive bullish bars trend bars closing on their high tells off the lows this is what we want to see we expect market continuation eventually we can
(16:27) see increase of bearish bars which means the correction is kicking in market can never go up indefinitely there needs to be correction phase and a push phase so the market is correcting that exponential moving average we expect uptrend continuation if the key entry point is going to hold and the candlestick is going to reject prices we can see that now we have some rejection but this is minimal rejection bearish bar here dogey indecision this is not a signal for me to go long just yet this is not a signal that the buyers are back in the market the correction can still
(16:59) continue because you can see the bars are still neutral or bearish only here I can see tails of these lows bullish bodies closing above the exponential moving average indicating buying reversal and market continues working higher and on the right we have no consecutive candles we have equal amount of bearish and bullish candles this is indicating consolidation small trading range we can consider selling at the top going to triangle rules you can see price action is going sideways just up and up and down a lot of stems on both sides we candlesticks consolidation so
(17:31) you can see the candles are telling you everything about intentions of all market participants who is in control you're using the candles to identify the structure and your actual entry point if there is good reaction okay we talked about fundamentals when it comes to candlestick patterns and how to actually trade candlestick patterns when it comes to trading candlestick patterns you have to understand that you use candlestick patterns you're identifying signal bars only once you understand what is the market structure this is the first
(17:59) question you need to ask yourself what is the market structure where is the market heading you must understand what the structure is and where the market is heading how you supposed to take a setup how you supposed to enter a position if you don't know where the market is heading when you're gambling and you're guessing if you're guessing you're not going to make it long in this business you need to make sure you're going to follow the rules of the strategy and you understand what the market is doing and if you don't understand that means the
(18:18) market is unclear you sit on your hands and you don't enter a position that's how you're going to protect your capital traders cannot look for trade entries without first understanding the market structure hyper setup will typically form at the key entry point such as EMA key level or trend line combined with the price action pattern to like a pullback confirmation setup traps fill breakouts etc you must think about the price action rules trend line rule says after break of a trend line you expect retest of an extreme according to trending range rules you want to buy low sell high fade the breakout that's how
(18:49) price action works once traders identify confluence of key entry points you should pay close attention to the candlestick pattern and the signal bar tier to refine your trading decision so what is the pattern right now what is the market structure so we can see we have key level of resistance because prices get rejected twice and we have key level of support because prices bounce twice many times off of this important key so we understand where the structure this is a trending range consolidation even the supportive indicator when bar EMA is flat so we know that we're focusing on buying low
(19:17) selling high we have two momentum candles and now we can see bearish depletion we spike down and suddenly this was a massive bearish bar and we don't have continuation we have a lot of stems a lot of tails we have increase in buying pressure we have a lot of bullish bars you can see how the bearish momentum completely dissipated and now we have bearish depletion new high come reset i have to redraw the downtrend first entry long pullback and we have potential second entry long so according to range rules I know that I want to fade the breakout it means trade against
(19:48) the breakout most breakouts are trading ranges will fail you want to buy low and a sell high this is why we're using these key levels so now we have sellers taking profits and look what happened here the signal bar here looked very bearish it looked like we're going to continue working lower but towards the close buyers stepped in they bought all the smart bulls and market reverse all the way back up and the bar is closing on its very high this is exactly what we like to see strong reversal candle closing on its high confirming everything about the market structure so
(20:20) we're using the market structure we're using the candlestick pattern to help us identify if the buyer stepped in if I see such a strong signal bar after two legs down at the bottom of the train range and I can see bullish reversal like this this is telling me that the bulls are back in the market and I can expect prices going back up i'm going to do the same thing to the upside i'm going to draw the trend line momentum consecutive bullish bars and now I can see bullish depletion okay you can see how no longer prices are going higher because we're at the top of the train range at important price level however I
(20:50) still cannot sell because the signal bars are terrible okay buyers are attempting to break the key level they're failing sellers are stronger in the market sellers are entering their positions buells are taking profits here and smart sellers are taking profits at the bottom so these signal bars are terrible a lot of stems lot of tails bullish bodies no break below this bar so I cannot really enter and I finally have very strong bearish bar indicating okay sellers are stepping in strong momentum at the top of the train range tier one single bar and we can
(21:23) enter if I want to navigate a trending range accurately I need to follow the trend line rule we can see every single time we have a shortterm channel on chart there's a second leg attempting to test the new extreme so you have one leg down break second leg down here we have price is breaking the bottom support a lot of sellers are going to get trapped it is a big bearish bar but based on the context we don't have to be worried about this because this is the second lag for the first lag new extreme and all the smart sellers are using this bar
(21:54) to take profits we have a bar down bar up massive bullish momentum very strong bullish bar closing on its high at the bottom of the consolidation after downtrend played out this is the exact area where you want to go long fell breakout strong bullish bar price is working higher breaking new high and now we're anticipating prices to sell the market is telling us everything we're combining the candlesticks with the overall context i want to go short but I don't have the opportunity we have very bad bars bullish bars a lot of tails
(22:25) weak bars signal bars inside bars i can't take anything here you can see by respecting the candlestick pattern we avoid having a losing trade bullish bar to top of the range is going to trap buyers massive reversal down strong tier one signal bar we expect prices to go back into the trading range so I'm only anticipating good candlestick pattern once the context and pattern align identifying high probability setup it's about combining the market structure with the candlestick pattern with the signal bar so when I'm analyzing the market when I'm analyzing the candlesticks on a chart I can see that
(23:03) every single high is lower and lower and every single low is lower and lower indicating to me that the market structure is bearish and I'm going to make the most money if I'm thinking about short opportunities only i can also identify the trend line because there's always a trend line present on the chart it fits the price action well and the trend is down so now that I understand the context I understand the key entry point now I'm paying attention if there's going to be a price action pattern to like a pullback at the key entry point and I can see that market
(23:32) corrected to the trend line and now I'm paying attention how strong the signal bar is going to be i can see the price action is reacting well to key entry points now the EMA and the trend line because you can see I have strong bearish bars right once we touch the key entry point area of confluence and this is the precise area where I want to see a good strong signal bar sellers are showing dominance over the buyers up to break new high and I can see both bars here are tier one single bars strong body nice and versatile we attempted to
(24:06) break higher reverse down and close on its very low without a tick at the bottom indicating very strong selling pressure everybody was selling you can see it was very hard to even catch this trade because market close open here and you have another strong momentum candle completely trading all the way down here once I'm at the bottom of this channel I'm no longer looking for how good the signal bar is going to be it's irrelevant it's about the context i want to sell at the right place the market is correcting i have a new high of the correction i'm not selling as long as
(24:35) this correction is in play i want to sell only if we break below EMA because I expect the new low for this downtrend going to channel rule i have a first entry long second entry long failure however the single bar is terrible we broke below this bullish bar this is a tier four single bar i cannot go short below this bullish bar even though the setup ended up working it may not happen this way every single time in the future okay I want to follow the rules i don't want to cherrypick so also it was a bit congested so I counted any here the signal bar was weak we corrected a
(25:06) little bit and now I have a trade opportunity i can sell at this EMA but let's analyze the candlestick we can see this is a tier two tier three signal bar something between it is not a terrible bar but also it is not the strongest bar the signal bar itself it's quite a dogey indicating indecision there's quite decent tell at the top but also tell at the bottom no strong body so the signal bar alone here is quite weak it's quite neutral that doesn't help because the context here is also bad you can see we are in a congestion we have candles up and up and down right next to each other
(25:39) this is a no trade zone and I can't enter a trade in a congestion when the signal bar is weak as well so there's a no go and shortly after we broke higher most breakouts will fail with the direction of the downtrend that's the main bias that's the main pattern and we have a strong bar we take higher reverse down all the bars got trapped we reverse down tier one single bar strong momentum and prices continue to trade to new extreme so we have to combine the structure the key entry point with the candlestick pattern to optimize the high probability
(26:10) setup how not to trade candlestick patterns a lot of traders especially novice traders beginner traders they get too excited about learning price action learning candlestick patterns and they're frantically taking the setups all over the place every single time the candle looks good but you cannot approach the market like this you cannot enter a trade based solely on a candlestick in a no man's land okay you cannot trade candlestick patterns in a vacuum you always have to have a good context that supports it you will not
(26:42) build your account if you keep frantically taking setups only based on how good the candlestick is this is why these candlestick patterns these general patterns such as tweezers gravestone dogey etc these combinations are dangerous to novice traders because you will not recognize the context correctly you will see some combination of candlesticks alone and you will end up with having a losing trade because you can see we have nice momentum here bullish bar we have bullish depletion and we have influx of sellers so this looks like a great short setup and here we have strong bearish candlestick as
(27:13) well but I'm going to analyze the context it happened here and it happened right here okay so as you can see the context doesn't support this candlestick pattern at all it doesn't matter how strong the single bar is i simply can't take a setup if it doesn't align with the context because analyzing the market structure I can see that I have series of higher highs and high lows there has to be a trend line and we're going to make the most money if we're going to be thinking only about long opportunities
(27:39) you can maybe squeeze the small scalp here but you can see if you're focused on long opportunities your job is much easier also how you don't want to use candlestick patterns is you want to avoid countrending so make sure to avoid countrending regardless how good the signal bar is also what you want to pay attention because sometimes you will miss a good long opportunity at the bottom where there's a key entry point area of confluence area of value and you may want to chase the market chase the entry too late for example here look at the nice signal bar here look at the
(28:10) gorgeous momentum bar and look at the strong bullish trend bar here but you cannot give in to fear of missing out you have to remember that you need to enter low when you're buying you need to enter at the key entry point you cannot enter far from the key entry point even though the single bar the candlestick alone is good you need to wait for prices to correct to the key entry point whatever the structure is and then look to buy at the bottom following the price action rules and identifying the signal
(28:36) bar at the bottom of the correction phase because you expect a brand new push phase to start so you can see the sellers are weak they can't break the trend line they can barely break the EMA this is indicating bearish depletion and you're just thinking about going long at the bottom you don't want to chase it at the top because you never know when the market's going to correct and stop you out signal bar is a candlestick pattern that is used to confirm a trade entry it's the last confirmation to get a high probability setup but there are instances where we don't have to have
(29:07) perfect signal bar every single time and we can still consider a potential opportunity a great trading opportunity so when does signal bar matter less number one when the context is clear how do you know the context is clear well mainly there are no conflicting variables and you know what to expect beforehand okay you know that the context is clear where nothing can surprise you and you already anticipate potential patterns set up to form before it even forms or when you have confluence of multiple key entry points
(29:40) we're going to talk about that take a look at the structure we have very strong downtrend this is a strong downtrend minimal bullish pullbacks strong consecutive bearish candles this is as strong as it gets we're breaking the trend line and we know upon breaking the trend line we automatically expect new to be tested according to trend line rule we broke the trend line in a form of like a pullback and we are at the EMA at the key entry point look at the second entry short signal bar if we're going to break below this bar there's going to be new low first entry short
(30:09) pullback second entry short high pattern so we're combining everything the candlestick alone is neutral this is not a good candlestick that we are excited about it has decent tail at the top but it has also tail at the bottom the body is neutral so this is a weak candlestick not a strong one but the context couldn't be easier to read no conflicting variables there is no trend range no bottom support no bullish reason to go long whatsoever the downtrend is clear as it gets so we're only thinking about selling everything played out so I can still consider
(30:40) selling even though the signal bar is weak because the context is so strong we have price is working higher the confirm uptrend and we have multiple key entry points number one the trend line number two the EMA and here number three small potential support and we have potential two trades the more key entry points in price action I have the better the more I can trust and I gain confidence in my analysis so these signal bars once again weak bodies nobody here even one tick bearish body so these signal bars are weak but we have nice tails off of these lows because towards the close buyer stepped
(31:19) in near the key entry point and reverse price is working higher indicating the buyers stepped in there was no selling pressure so even though these signal bars are weak you can play around with the idea of potentially going long here because the context is clear and you have multiple key entry points personally I would probably skip this setup right here given the fact that we also have some small consolidation potential resistance but if there's no resistance we can consider but this setup is better the push higher breakout
(31:49) pullback EMA keeps holding almost trend line is holding so once again a signal bar doesn't have to be perfect if you have a lot of key entry points and the context is very clear and you know what to expect beforehand on the other hand signal bar matters a lot the candlestick pattern is important when you're just thinking that you know what's happening the context is weak it's not fully confirmed you're not sure that your key entry point is the valid one so you definitely need a very strong signal bar
(32:14) to confirm okay the buyers are in the market the sellers are stepping in etc etc you need a good signal bar to confirm the weak market context to confirm potential key entry point you're not so sure about you need a strong signal bar or for example when I'm taking more aggressive trades I also prefer to have strong signal bar for example buying low selling high fading breakouts attempting some early reversal or when we are super far from the EMA I want to ride it back i really need very good single bar when I'm taking a little bit more aggressive setup not textbook second entry short like
(32:43) this two bar candlestick patterns now you understand how to read candlestick patterns what the candles are telling you about the markets and you understand that you need to judge candles based on their T list to understand if there's enough momentum and pressure in the market now we're going to dive deeper and we're going to talk about more advanced candlestick patterns two bar candlestick patterns the first pattern is going to be the inside bar pattern the inside bar pattern is a two candlestick formation where the high of the second candle is lower than the high
(33:15) of the previous bar and the low is higher than the low of the previous bar it basically means that your signal bar is completely engulfed by the previous bar we're going to talk about bearish inside bar in front of us we have this signal bar right here market is correcting to the exponential moving average and there's a nice bearish bar where you may want to consider selling below the signal bar but we're going to analyze this formation closely we can see this is no ordinary signal bar this is no ordinary candlestick this entire candle is inside of the previous candle
(33:49) you can see the high of this bearish bar and the low of this bearish bar is still within the range of the previous bar the high is lower than the previous bar and the low is higher than the previous bar you can see the bearish bar is completely engulfed and is inside of the previous bullish bar that we can call outside bar and the next bar is inside bar we're going to take a look at bullish example we have new high first entry long second entry long so market moves in pairs of twos and you're thinking about going long and you can see this bullish bar right here the high of this bullish candle and the low of
(34:30) this bullish candle is completely inside of the previous bar okay you can see the previous bar the high and the low is engulfing the following bar this is the inside bar and the bearish bar is the outside bar now why is this so important and why this detail matters this detail matters because it's telling you the inside bar pattern that there is not enough strength and momentum for the sellers and what do I mean by this let's take a look at this example picture a scenario where you have bullish bar which means the market is correcting there's a first leg for the correction little pullback and market is correcting
(35:08) the bulls are correcting to the expial moving average if you can see market opening here and you can see price is going higher which means all these bulls they're going to buy their orders are going to be filled but the market reverses down this will indicate bullish trap this will indicate there is enough of bearish momentum in the market there is strong reversal because market traded higher which means there is some momentum for the buyers but all of this momentum completely dissipated once we broke above this bar and suddenly
(35:39) sellers stepped in and market completely reverse down so this is indicating good reversal pressure for the sellers or picture the scenario number two where this bar closes and the next bearish bar opens market's going to trade all the way down here it's going to break the low of the previous candle which means there is strong enough momentum straight from the beginning of the formation of this bar so either way if you're going to break higher and then reverse down this is a sign of reversal or you're going to open and you're going to continue breaking lower this is sign of
(36:10) strength and momentum for the sellers but this right here this inside bar the market just opened and the sellers didn't do anything we didn't break higher and reverse down nor we continue trending lower this is just weak signal bar the market pressure is insignificant and this is generally not a good signal bar we want to sell below we want to see either one of these scenarios either break highs down or break the low of the previous bar because that is a sign that the sellers are in the market and they're strong so for this reason I recommend avoiding inside bar entries
(36:38) especially if you're a novice trader sometimes it can work but for the most part it is indicating weak price action and you don't want your signal bar to be inside bar you want to take a position above or below when the signal bar is inside of the previous bar now it's going to make more sense because the second two bar candlestick pattern we're going to talk about engulfing candle the engulfing pattern engulfing pattern the engulfing candle will indicate strong momentum and reversal pressure in the market it means that the high of the engulfing candle is
(37:10) higher than the previous bar and the low is lower than the previous bar engulfing candle is a larger it's larger than the preceding bar and completely engulfves it so let's take a look at this scenario we have the previous bar which is bullish once again the market is correcting we're correcting to the EMA you can see the bullish like working higher part of the bearish trend market corrected and we have another attempt by the bulls to break the exponential moving average but you can see the high of the secondary bar is higher than the
(37:39) previous bar and the low of the secondary bar is lower than the previous bar and this is important because this means that the market initially continue working higher the bulls were strong but they were tricked they were tricked because EMA in a downtrend is a key entry point and eventually market reversed all the way down and not only it tricked the bulls all of their orders they got filled it reversed down so these bulls are trapped it also managed to break the low of the previous bar so we managed to get two scenarios in this example we broke higher we reversed down and we managed to break the low of the
(38:14) previous bullish candle so you can see how this bearish bar is completely engulfing the previous bar and this is a good sign of reversal momentum of strength and of pressure that the sellers are in the market because they manage after market broke higher completely reverse the market lower and completely go of the previous candle what is not engulfing pattern you can see this would not be engulfing pattern because even though we initially broke above the bullish bar we broke higher and market continued to trade lower the low of the second bar is still higher
(38:45) than the low of the previous bar so this would not be engulfing pattern this would be a normal signal bar entry we broke higher reverse down engulfing pattern means that this bearish bar the secondary bar needs to go lower and even break the low of the previous bar just like it happened right here let's talk about bullish engulfing pattern you have a new high first entry long second in long you have a bearish bar working lower the market is correcting the market open prices continue to trade lower in the bear direction but market completely reverse all the way up and
(39:16) the high is higher than the previous bar so this bullish bar is completely engulfing with its extremes the previous bar which is indicating strong bullish momentum and strong reversal for the buyers because initially it looked like prices are going to trade lower but the buyers stepped in sellers got tricked and the bullish momentum increase and market completely reverse all the way up so you can see how the momentum is there and the engulfing pattern is telling you that the buyers are really buying at this particular price level once again what is not engulfing pattern you can
(39:45) see this is not engulfing pattern even though we broke and we reversed back to the upside the high of this bullish bar is still lower than the high of the previous bar of course this is not engulfing pattern because you would need this bullish bar completely break and engulf the previous bar the engulfing candle offers traders one additional way how to enter a trade that is a little bit different than you would normally enter a trade normally most of the times you want to wait for the signal bar to finish okay if you're novice trader if you're beginner trader you every single
(40:17) time want to wait for candlestick to finish because you need to see how the candle ended so if it is a good tier candlestick or not but sometimes more advanced traders they can enter a gulfing entry which means when for example take a look at this example we have a bearish correction working lower and you are witnessing live that the market looks bearish initially it broke lower but suddenly market is reversing all the way up in the opposite direction so more advanced trader because he can see the momentum in the market you can see how the sellers got trapped and
(40:49) there is suddenly influx of buyers the market is trending higher suddenly more adventurer can actually enter without waiting for this bull bar to finish can enter one tick above the previous bar because when you're watching this live and the context is good you can see how the momentum is accumulating and there's massive pressure in the market for the buyers once again if you're novice trader you need to wait for this bar to finish for the secondary bar but more advanced trader can actually risk entry
(41:14) like this without waiting for this bar to finish because the momentum is so strong and you only want to use this for a trap for a failed second entry because when the traders are trapped on the opposite side and you can see the momentum it makes sense right now to bet on this entry because you can actually save more ticks and have larger target profit the last two bar candlestick pattern we're going to talk about is the double bar entry a double bar entry is a trading technique used to enter a trade when the initial signal bar does not follow price action rules which means
(41:49) the tier of the initial signal bar is bad and we can't enter the position what's important to understand that we're using the double bar entry only when the context is good in this example the context is easy to read because it's clearly a bullish trend we understand the market is going higher so we understand the bias and the key entry point is confirmed so in this particular example I can see that I have some market geometry series of higher lows i can use this geometry to draw a trend line this is a strong uptrend i can also draw a small consolidation because
(42:20) market is going sideways this is a small consolidation and I have second entry long market moves in pairs of twos you have a new high resential long pullback second entry long which is also combined with a failed breakout because most breakouts out of consolidations will fail especially since I'm going to combine this with the main bullish bias so I have a lot of key entry points i have the EMA I have the trend line this is a second entry long and this is also a fail breakout so context is super clear so what does it mean to enter this position as a double bar entry let's talk about this so now we're going to
(42:53) take a closer look we have a new high this is the highest high of the price working high which means I have to reset the count when I'm using the counting technique we have a first entry long because we broke high the first attempt to go long but we're not going to go long because we know market moves was in pairs of twos prices are turning lower and now we're about to have a second entry long and there's going to be break above this bearish bar because after first entry long the next bar is going to get a break above its high that's the second entry long is the second attempt but I can see that this bar right here
(43:22) the technical second entry this right here is bearish bar and I cannot go long above bearish bar this is a horrible signal but where the market is going to go lower what is going to trap me this is not a good signal that the buyers are in the market okay what is the key entry point not going to hold i need to buy above bullish signal bar that is very important so this technical second entry I cannot take it but I can use the double bar entry formation because the context is so clear let me just wait a little bit if the secondary bar is going to be okay to enter and I can see that
(43:53) indeed the secondary bar is a nice bullish bar so I can combine these two candlesticks together and I can enter on this secondary bar because the context is so good so I can afford to skip the initial entry because the signal bar is bad and I can afford to wait a little bit because the context is so clear so the way I'm going to enter this situation is I need to wait for the break above this bullish bar because I need to see this bullish bar getting the break i'm using this right here as my signal bar so there's going to be break
(44:22) above this bullish bar then I can consider the entry triggering and I can drop my limit order or you can go long one tick above the single bar what I prefer to do is I prefer to wait for the break above and drop my limit order few ticks back because double bar entry they tend to be quite big because you're combining both candlesticks so I want to decrease the risk so I generally wait for break and I drop my limit order and see if market can come back and fill me in what is very important to understand that your stop loss has to go one tick
(44:51) not below the bar two the bullish bar but below the bar one the initial signal bar you have to use the lowest point in this swing to protect your position so my stop loss goes below the initial bar even though I'm not entering above this bar I'm not using this I'm using the secondary bar I still need to use the low of this bar because it's a two bar pattern to protect my trade so I'm using the following bar to go long and I'm using the previous bar to place my stop loss this way even if the signal bar is bad I can take advantage of the
(45:20) situation when the context is so clear so this right here would be the practical second entry when we actually enter this position on and market continues to go higher what you prefer is the secondary bar not to be too big you like the double bar entry pattern both candles to be fairly close to each other because if this bullish bar is going to close somewhere around here then most of the sculp is already made you prefer these candles be very close to each other where it basically merges into one and it looks like one signal bar and remember when the context is not
(45:49) clear and you're not sure you don't really want to use double bar entry because the initial signal bar is weak and that is not a good confirmation of the context so you use the double bar entry even with the bad initial signal bar when you're confident in your read when the context is unclear and the market is sketchy you want really nice confirmation with the signal bar to clear your doubts so this was the video about understanding candlesticks now you can see and you learn the language of the market you can see how every single candlestick on the chart is telling you something you know how to recognize indecision momentum and the pressure if
